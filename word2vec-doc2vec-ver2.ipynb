      "\n",
      "\n",
      "   We consider a region of Minkowski spacetime bounded either by one or by two parallel, infinitely extended plates orthogonal to a spatial direction and a real KleinGordon field satisfying Dirichlet boundary conditions. We quantize these two systems within the algebraic approach to quantum field theory using the socalled functional formalism. As a first step we construct a suitable unital *algebra of observables whose generating functionals are characterized by a labelling space which is at the same time optimal and separating and fulfils the Flocality property. Subsequently we give a definition for these systems of Hadamard states and we investigate explicit examples. In the case of a single plate, it turns out that one can build algebraic states via a pullback of those on the whole Minkowski spacetime, moreover inheriting from them the Hadamard property. When we consider instead two plates, algebraic states can be put in correspondence with those on flat spacetime via the socalled method of images, which we translate to the algebraic setting. For a massless scalar field we show that this procedure works perfectly for a large class of quasifree states including the Poincar\\'e vacuum and KMS states. Eventually Wick polynomials are introduced. Contrary to the Minkowski case, the extended algebras, built in globally hyperbolic subregions can be collected in a global counterpart only after a suitable deformation which is expressed locally in terms of a *isomorphism. As a last step, we construct explicitly the twopoint function and the regularized energy density, showing, moreover, that the outcome is consistent with the standard results of the Casimir effect. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "   Integrable models provide an exact description for a wide variety of physical phenomena. For example nested integrable systems contain different species of interacting particles with a rich phenomenology in their collective behavior, which is the origin of the unconventional phenomenon of spincharge separation. So far, however, most of the theoretical work in the study of nonequilibrium dynamics of integrable systems has been focusing on models with an elementary (i.e., not nested) Bethe ansatz. In this work we explicitly investigate quantum quenches in nested integrable systems, by generalizing the application of the Quench Action approach. Specifically, we consider the spin LaiSutherland model, described, in the thermodynamic limit, by the theory of two different species of Betheansatz particles, each one forming an infinite number of bound states. We focus on the situation where the quench dynamics starts from a simple matrix product state for which the overlaps with the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian are known. We fully characterize the postquench steady state and perform several consistency checks for the validity of our results. Finally, we provide predictions for the propagation of entanglement and mutual information after the quench, which can be used as signature of the quasiparticle content of the model. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "   In this article, we study compactifications of homogeneous spaces coming from equivariant, open embeddings into a generalized flag manifold . The key to this approach is that in each case  is the homogeneous model for a parabolic geometry; the theory of such geometries provides a large supply of geometric tools and invariant differential operators that can be used for this study. A classical theorem of J.~Wolf shows that any involutive automorphism of a semisimple Lie group  with fixed point group  gives rise to a large family of such compactifications of homogeneous spaces of . Most examples of (classical) Riemannian symmetric spaces as well as many nonsymmetric examples arise in this way. A specific feature of the approach is that any compactification of that type comes with the notion of \"curved analog\" to which the tools we develop also apply. The model example of this is a general Poincar\\'eEinstein manifold forming the curved analog of the conformal compactification of hyperbolic space.   In the first part of the article, we derive general tools for the analysis of such compactifications. In the second part, we analyze two families of examples in detail, which in particular contain compactifications of the symmetric spaces  and . We describe the decomposition of the compactification into orbits, show how orbit closures can be described as the zero sets of smooth solutions to certain invariant differential operators and prove a local slice theorem around each orbit in these examples. \n",

      "\n",
      "   We study the homogeneous CauchyDirichlet Problem (CDP) for a nonlinear and nonlocal diffusion equation of singular type of the form  posed on a bounded Euclidean domain  with smooth boundary and . The linear diffusion operator  is a subMarkovian operator, allowed to be of nonlocal type, while the nonlinearity is of singular type, namely  with . The prototype equation is the Fractional Fast Diffusion Equation (FFDE), when  is one of the three possible Dirichlet Fractional Laplacians on .   Our main results shall provide a complete basic theory for solutions to (CDP): existence and uniqueness in the biggest class of data known so far, both for nonnegative and signed solutions; sharp smoothing estimates: besides the classical  smoothing effects, we provide new weighted estimates, which represent a novelty also in well studied local case, i.e. for solutions to the FDE . We compare two strategies to prove smoothing effects: Moser iteration VS Green function method.   Due to the singular nonlinearity and to presence of nonlocal diffusion operators, the question of how solutions satisfy the lateral boundary conditions is delicate. We answer with quantitative upper boundary estimates that show how boundary data are taken.   Once solutions exists and are bounded we show that they extinguish in finite time and we provide upper and lower estimates for the extinction time, together with explicit sharp extinction rates in different norms.   The methods of this paper are constructive, in the sense that all the relevant constants involved in the estimates are computable. \n",

      " [ Cosine Similarity= 0.923 ]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "   Originally arising in the context of interacting particle systems in statistical physics, dynamical systems and differential equations on networks/graphs have permeated into a broad number of mathematical areas as well as into many applications. One central problem in the field is to find suitable approximations of the dynamics as the number of nodes/vertices tends to infinity, i.e., in the large graph limit. A cornerstone in this context are VlasovFokkerPlanck equations (VFPEs) describing a particle density on a meanfield level. For alltoall coupled systems, it is quite classical to prove the rigorous approximation by VFPEs for many classes of particle systems. For dense graphs converging to graphon limits, one also knows that meanfield approximation holds for certain classes of models, e.g., for the Kuramoto model on graphs. Yet, the space of intermediate density and sparse graphs is clearly extremely relevant.

In practical applications, however, the underlying pseudoRiemannian metric may often be degenerate, and such an excellent geometric structure is rarely defined on the entire space. To fix this trouble, in the present paper, we propose a novel generalization of the dually flat structure for a certain class of singular models from the viewpoint of Lagrange and Legendre singularity theory  we introduce a quasiHessian manifold endowed with a possibly degenerate metric and a particular symmetric cubic tensor, which exceeds the concept of statistical manifolds and is adapted to the theory of (weak) contrast functions. In particular, we establish AmariNagaoka's extended Pythagorean theorem and projection theorem in this general setup, and consequently, most of applications of these theorems are suitably justified even for such singular cases.

      "   Cubic spline interpolation on Euclidean space is a standard topic in numerical analysis, with countless applications in science and technology. In several emerging fields, for example computer vision and quantum control, there is a growing need for spline interpolation on curved, nonEuclidean space. The generalization of cubic splines to manifolds is not selfevident, with several distinct approaches. One possibility is to mimic the acceleration minimizing property, which leads to Riemannian cubics. This, however, require the solution of a coupled set of nonlinear boundary value problems that cannot be integrated explicitly, even if formulae for geodesics are available. Another possibility is to mimic De~Casteljau's algorithm, which leads to generalized B\\'ezier curves. To construct C2splines from such curves is a complicated nonlinear problem, until now lacking numerical methods. Here we provide an iterative algorithm for C2splines on Riemannian symmetric spaces, and we prove convergence of linear order. In terms of numerical tractability and computational efficiency, the new method surpasses those based on Riemannian cubics. Each iteration is parallel, thus suitable for multicore implementation. We demonstrate the algorithm for three geometries of interest: the sphere, complex projective space, and the real Grassmannian. \n",

      "   Motivated by variational models in continuum mechanics, we introduce a novel algorithm to perform nonsmooth and nonconvex minimizations with linear constraints in Euclidean spaces. We show how this algorithm is actually a natural generalization of the wellknown nonstationary augmented Lagrangian method for convex optimization. The relevant features of this approach are its applicability to a large variety of nonsmooth and nonconvex objective functions, its guaranteed convergence to critical points of the objective energy independently of the choice of the initial value, and its simplicity of implementation. In fact, the algorithm results in a nested double loop iteration. In the inner loop an augmented Lagrangian algorithm performs an adaptive finite number of iterations on a fixed quadratic and strictly convex perturbation of the objective energy, depending on a parameter which is adapted by the external loop. To show the versatility of this new algorithm, we exemplify how it can be used for computing critical points in inverse freediscontinuity variational models, such as the MumfordShah functional, and, by doing so, we also derive and analyze new iterative thresholding algorithms. \n",

      "   A Sheaf Neural Network (SNN) is a type of Graph Neural Network (GNN) that operates on a sheaf, an object that equips a graph with vector spaces over its nodes and edges and linear maps between these spaces. SNNs have been shown to have useful theoretical properties that help tackle issues arising from heterophily and oversmoothing. One complication intrinsic to these models is finding a good sheaf for the task to be solved. Previous works proposed two diametrically opposed approaches: manually constructing the sheaf based on domain knowledge and learning the sheaf endtoend using gradientbased methods. However, domain knowledge is often insufficient, while learning a sheaf could lead to overfitting and significant computational overhead. In this work, we propose a novel way of computing sheaves drawing inspiration from Riemannian geometry: we leverage the manifold assumption to compute manifoldandgraphaware orthogonal maps, which optimally align the tangent spaces of neighbouring data points. We show that this approach achieves promising results with less computational overhead when compared to previous SNN models. Overall, this work provides an interesting connection between algebraic topology and differential geometry, and we hope that it will spark future research in this direction. \n",

      "   We consider a region of Minkowski spacetime bounded either by one or by two parallel, infinitely extended plates orthogonal to a spatial direction and a real KleinGordon field satisfying Dirichlet boundary conditions. We quantize these two systems within the algebraic approach to quantum field theory using the socalled functional formalism. As a first step we construct a suitable unital *algebra of observables whose generating functionals are characterized by a labelling space which is at the same time optimal and separating and fulfils the Flocality property. Subsequently we give a definition for these systems of Hadamard states and we investigate explicit examples. In the case of a single plate, it turns out that one can build algebraic states via a pullback of those on the whole Minkowski spacetime, moreover inheriting from them the Hadamard property. When we consider instead two plates, algebraic states can be put in correspondence with those on flat spacetime via the socalled method of images, which we translate to the algebraic setting. For a massless scalar field we show that this procedure works perfectly for a large class of quasifree states including the Poincar\\'e vacuum and KMS states. Eventually Wick polynomials are introduced. Contrary to the Minkowski case, the extended algebras, built in globally hyperbolic subregions can be collected in a global counterpart only after a suitable deformation which is expressed locally in terms of a *isomorphism. As a last step, we construct explicitly the twopoint function and the regularized energy density, showing, moreover, that the outcome is consistent with the standard results of the Casimir effect. \n",

      "   Integrable models provide an exact description for a wide variety of physical phenomena. For example nested integrable systems contain different species of interacting particles with a rich phenomenology in their collective behavior, which is the origin of the unconventional phenomenon of spincharge separation. So far, however, most of the theoretical work in the study of nonequilibrium dynamics of integrable systems has been focusing on models with an elementary (i.e., not nested) Bethe ansatz. In this work we explicitly investigate quantum quenches in nested integrable systems, by generalizing the application of the Quench Action approach. Specifically, we consider the spin LaiSutherland model, described, in the thermodynamic limit, by the theory of two different species of Betheansatz particles, each one forming an infinite number of bound states. We focus on the situation where the quench dynamics starts from a simple matrix product state for which the overlaps with the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian are known. We fully characterize the postquench steady state and perform several consistency checks for the validity of our results. Finally, we provide predictions for the propagation of entanglement and mutual information after the quench, which can be used as signature of the quasiparticle content of the model. \n",

The key to this approach is that in each case  is the homogeneous model for a parabolic geometry; the theory of such geometries provides a large supply of geometric tools and invariant differential operators that can be used for this study. A classical theorem of J.~Wolf shows that any involutive automorphism of a semisimple Lie group  with fixed point group  gives rise to a large family of such compactifications of homogeneous spaces of . Most examples of (classical) Riemannian symmetric spaces as well as many nonsymmetric examples arise in this way. A specific feature of the approach is that any compactification of that type comes with the notion of \"curved analog\" to which the tools we develop also apply. The model example of this is a general Poincar\\'eEinstein manifold forming the curved analog of the conformal compactification of hyperbolic space.   In the first part of the article, we derive general tools for the analysis of such compactifications. In the second part, we analyze two families of examples in detail, which in particular contain compactifications of the symmetric spaces  and . We describe the decomposition of the compactification into orbits, show how orbit closures can be described as the zero sets of smooth solutions to certain invariant differential operators and prove a local slice theorem around each orbit in these examples. \n",

The linear diffusion operator  is a subMarkovian operator, allowed to be of nonlocal type, while the nonlinearity is of singular type, namely  with . The prototype equation is the Fractional Fast Diffusion Equation (FFDE), when  is one of the three possible Dirichlet Fractional Laplacians on .   Our main results shall provide a complete basic theory for solutions to (CDP): existence and uniqueness in the biggest class of data known so far, both for nonnegative and signed solutions; sharp smoothing estimates: besides the classical  smoothing effects, we provide new weighted estimates, which represent a novelty also in well studied local case, i.e. for solutions to the FDE . We compare two strategies to prove smoothing effects: Moser iteration VS Green function method.   Due to the singular nonlinearity and to presence of nonlocal diffusion operators, the question of how solutions satisfy the lateral boundary conditions is delicate. We answer with quantitative upper boundary estimates that show how boundary data are taken.   Once solutions exists and are bounded we show that they extinguish in finite time and we provide upper and lower estimates for the extinction time, together with explicit sharp extinction rates in different norms.   The methods of this paper are constructive, in the sense that all the relevant constants involved in the estimates are computable. \n",

      "   Originally arising in the context of interacting particle systems in statistical physics, dynamical systems and differential equations on networks/graphs have permeated into a broad number of mathematical areas as well as into many applications. One central problem in the field is to find suitable approximations of the dynamics as the number of nodes/vertices tends to infinity, i.e., in the large graph limit. A cornerstone in this context are VlasovFokkerPlanck equations (VFPEs) describing a particle density on a meanfield level. For alltoall coupled systems, it is quite classical to prove the rigorous approximation by VFPEs for many classes of particle systems. For dense graphs converging to graphon limits, one also knows that meanfield approximation holds for certain classes of models, e.g., for the Kuramoto model on graphs. Yet, the space of intermediate density and sparse graphs is clearly extremely relevant. Here we prove that the Kuramoto model can be be approximated in the meanfield limit by far more general graph limits than graphons. In particular, our contributions are as follows. (I) We show, how to introduce operator theory more abstractly into VFPEs by considering graphops.

      "   We elaborate on the recent proposal that intersection numbers of certain cohomology classes on the moduli space of genuszero Riemann surfaces with punctures compute treelevel scattering amplitudes in quantum field theories. The relevant cohomology classes are twisted by representations of the fundamental group that describes how punctures braid around each other on the Riemann surface, which can be used to link it to the space of kinematic invariants. Intersection numbers of said cohomology classes, whose representatives we call twisted forms, can be shown to fully localize on the boundaries of the moduli space, which are in onetoone map with Feynman diagrams. We prove that when twisted forms are logarithmic, their intersection numbers have a simple expansion in terms of trivalent Feynman diagrams allowing only for massless propagators on the internal and external lines. For physical applications one also needs to study nonlogarithmic forms as they are responsible for propagation of massive states. We utilize the natural fibre bundle structure of the moduli space, which allows for a direct access to the boundaries, to introduce recursion relations for intersection numbers that \"integrate out\" puncturebypuncture. The resulting recursion involves only linear algebra of certain matrices describing braiding properties of the moduli space and evaluating onedimensional residues, thus paving a way for explicit analytic computations of scattering amplitudes. Together with the previous reformulation of the treelevel Smatrix of string theory in terms of twisted forms, the results of this work complete a unified geometric framework for studying scattering amplitudes from genuszero Riemann surfaces. We show that a web of dualities between different homology and cohomology groups allows for deriving a host of identities among various types of amplitudes computed from the moduli space. \n",

      "   We describe a method for exactly diagonalizing clean dimensional lattice systems of independent fermions subject to arbitrary boundary conditions in one direction, as well as systems composed of two bulks meeting at a planar interface. Our method builds on the generalized Bloch theorem  and the fact that the bulkboundary separation of the Schrodinger equation is compatible with a partial Fourier transform operation. Bulk equations may display unusual features because they are relative eigenvalue problems for nonHermitian, bulkprojected Hamiltonians. Nonetheless, they admit a rich symmetry analysis that can simplify considerably the structure of energy eigenstates, often allowing a solution in fully analytical form. We illustrate our extension of the generalized Bloch theorem to multicomponent systems by determining the exact Andreev bound states for a simple SNS junction. We then analyze the Creutz ladder model, by way of a conceptual bridge from one to higher dimensions. Upon introducing a new Gaussian duality transformation that maps the Creutz ladder to a system of two Majorana chains, we show how the model provides a first example of a shortrange chiral topological insulator hosting topological zero modes with a powerlaw profile. Additional applications include the complete analytical diagonalization of graphene ribbons with both zigzagbearded and armchair boundary conditions, and the analytical determination of the edge modes in a chiral  twodimensional topological superconductor. Lastly, we revisit the phenomenon of Majorana flat bands and anomalous bulkboundary correspondence in a twoband gapless wave topological superconductor. We analyze the equilibrium Josephson response of the system, showing how the presence of Majorana flat bands implies a substantial enhancement in the periodic supercurrent. \n",

We consider the socalled slow diffusion regime, corresponding to a degenerate behaviour at the level 0, \\normalcolor in which nonnegative solutions with compactly supported initial data have a compact support for any later time. For some results we will also require  to avoid the possibility of a singular behaviour away from 0.   Problems in this family have a unique (up to translations) travelling wave with a finite front. When the initial datum is bounded, radially symmetric and compactly supported, we will prove that solutions converging to 1 (which exist, as we show, for all the reaction terms under consideration for wide classes of initial data) do so by approaching a translation of this unique traveling wave in the radial direction, but with a logarithmic correction in the position of the front when the dimension is bigger than one. As a corollary we obtain the asymptotic location of the free boundary and level sets in the nonradial case up to an error term of size . In dimension one we extend our results to cover the case of nonsymmetric initial data, as well as the case of bounded initial data with supporting sets unbounded in one direction of the real line. A main technical tool of independent interest is an estimate for the flux.   Most of our results are new even for the special cases of the porous medium equation and the Laplacian evolution equation. \n",

      "   Fourdimensional spacetimes foliated by a twoparameter family of homologous twosurfaces are considered in Einstein's theory of gravity. By combining a 1+(1+2) decomposition, the canonical form of the spacetime metric and a suitable specification of the conformal structure of the foliating twosurfaces a gauge fixing is introduced. It is shown that, in terms of the chosen geometrically distinguished variables, the 1+3 Hamiltonian and momentum constraints can be recast into the form of a parabolic equation and a first order symmetric hyperbolic system, respectively. Initial data to this system can be given on one of the twosurfaces foliating the threedimensional initial data surface. The 1+3 reduced Einstein's equations are also determined. By combining the 1+3 momentum constraint with the reduced system of the secondary 1+2 decomposition a mixed hyperbolichyperbolic system is formed. It is shown that solutions to this mixed hyperbolichyperbolic system are also solutions to the full set of Einstein's equations provided that the 1+3 Hamiltonian constraint is solved on the initial data surface  and the 1+2 Hamiltonian and momentum type expressions vanish on a worldtube yielded by the Lie transport of one of the twosurfaces foliating  along the time evolution vector field. Whenever the foliating twosurfaces are compact without boundary in the spacetime and a regular origin exists on the timeslicesthis is the location where the foliating twosurfaces smoothly reduce to a pointit suffices to guarantee that the 1+3 Hamiltonian constraint holds on the initial data surface. A short discussion on the use of the geometrically distinguished variables in identifying the degrees of freedom of gravity are also included. \n",

It was assumed that such a surface could be constructed using eigensolutions of the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation for the molecular (Coulomb) Hamiltonian but at that time such calculations were not possible. Nowadays quantum mechanical abinitio electronic structure calculations are routine and from their results PESs can be constructed which are believed to approximate those assumed derivable from the eigensolutions. It is argued here that this belief is unfounded.

For larger gauge groups one generally finds vortex equations involving several matrixvalued Higgs fields. Here we focus on YangMills theory with gauge group  and a special reduction which yields only one nonabelian Higgs field. One of the new features of this reduction is the fact that while the instanton number of the theory in four dimensions is generally fractional with denominator , we still obtain an integral vortex number in the reduced theory. We clarify the relation between these two topological charges at a bundle geometric level. Another striking feature is the emergence of nontrivial lower and upper bounds for the energy of the reduced theory on . These bounds are proportional to the area of . We give special solutions of the theory on  by embedding solutions of the abelian Higgs model into the nonabelian theory, and we relate our work to the language of quiver bundles, which has recently proved fruitful in the study of dimensional reduction of YangMills theory. \n",

      "   A quantization over a manifold can be seen as a way to construct a differential operator with prescribed principal symbol. The quantization map is moreover required to be a linear bijection. It is known that there is in general no natural quantization procedure. However, considering manifolds endowed with additional structures, such as projective or pseudoconformal structures, one can seek for quantizations that depend on this additional structure and that are natural if the dependence with respect to the structure is taken into account.   The question of existence of such a quantization was addressed in a series of papers in the context of projective geometry, using the framework of ThomasWhitehead connections (see Bordemann, Hansoul and Fox). Recently, we recovered these existence results, using the theory of Cartan projective connections.   In the present work, we show that our method can be adapted to pseudoconformal geometry to yield the socalled natural and conformally invariant quantization for arbitrary symbols, still outside some critical situations. Our method is general enough to analyze the problem of invariant quantizations in the context of manifolds with irreducible parabolic geometries. \n",

The C*algebra we construct generalizes the usual CCRalgebras since, contrary to the standard fieldtheoretic models, it is based on a presymplectic Abelian group instead of a symplectic vector space. We prove a nogo theorem according to which neither this functor, nor any of its quotients, satisfies the strict axioms of general local covariance. As a byproduct, we prove that a morphism violates the locality axiom if and only if a certain induced morphism of cohomology groups is noninjective. We then show that fixing any principal U(1)bundle, there exists a suitable category of subbundles for which a quotient of our functor yields a quantum field theory in the sense of Haag and Kastler.

      "   We propose the extension of some structural aspects that have successfully been applied in the development of the theory of quantum fields propagating on a general spacetime manifold so as to include superfield models on a supermanifold. We only deal with the limited class of supermanifolds which admit the existence of a smooth body manifold structure. Our considerations are based on the CatenacciReinaTeofillattoBryant approach to supermanifolds. In particular, we show that the class of supermanifolds constructed by BonoraPastiTonin satisfies the criterions which guarantee that a supermanifold admits a Hausdorff body manifold. This construction is the closest to the physicist's intuitive view of superspace as a manifold with some anticommuting coordinates, where the odd sector is topologically trivial. The paper also contains a new construction of superdistributions and useful results on the wavefront set of such objects. Moreover, a generalization of the spectral condition is formulated using the notion of the wavefront set of superdistributions, which is equivalent to the requirement that all of the component fields satisfy, on the body manifold, a microlocal spectral condition proposed by BrunettiFredenhagenK\\\"ohler. \n",

      "\n",
      "   We study the problem of finding the global Riemannian center of mass of a set of data points on a Riemannian manifold. Specifically, we investigate the convergence of constant stepsize gradient descent algorithms for solving this problem. The challenge is that often the underlying cost function is neither globally differentiable nor convex, and despite this one would like to have guaranteed convergence to the global minimizer. After some necessary preparations we state a conjecture which we argue is the best (in a sense described) convergence condition one can hope for. The conjecture specifies conditions on the spread of the data points, stepsize range, and the location of the initial condition (i.e., the region of convergence) of the algorithm. These conditions depend on the topology and the curvature of the manifold and can be conveniently described in terms of the injectivity radius and the sectional curvatures of the manifold. For manifolds of constant nonnegative curvature (e.g., the sphere and the rotation group in ) we show that the conjecture holds true (we do this by proving and using a comparison theorem which seems to be of a different nature from the standard comparison theorems in Riemannian geometry). For manifolds of arbitrary curvature we prove convergence results which are weaker than the conjectured one (but still superior over the available results). We also briefly study the effect of the configuration of the data points on the speed of convergence. \n",

Conditional on a very plausible assumption, we prove that this is indeed the case when g is large. The proof combines a soft geometric limit argument with a detailed NeumannZagier asymptotic formula for the volumes of Dehn fillings.   Our examples are all Dehn fillings on the sibling of the Whitehead manifold, and we also analyze the dilatations of all closed surface bundles obtained in this way, identifying those with minimal dilatation. This gives new families of pseudoAnosovs with low dilatation, including a genus 7 example which minimizes dilatation among all those with orientable invariant foliations. \n",

      "   We consider the Laplacian associated with a general metric in the canonical conformal structure of the noncommutative two torus, and calculate a local expression for the term a_4 that appears in its corresponding smalltime heat kernel expansion. The final formula involves one variable functions and lengthy two, three and four variable functions of the modular automorphism of the state that encodes the conformal perturbation of the flat metric. We confirm the validity of the calculated expressions by showing that they satisfy a family of conceptually predicted functional relations. By studying these functional relations abstractly, we derive a partial differential system which involves a natural action of cyclic groups of order two, three and four and a flow in parameter space. We discover symmetries of the calculated expressions with respect to the action of the cyclic groups. In passing, we show that the main ingredients of our calculations, which come from a rearrangement lemma and relations between the derivatives up to order four of the conformal factor and those of its logarithm, can be derived by finite differences from the generating function of the Bernoulli numbers and its multiplicative inverse. We then shed light on the significance of exponential polynomials and their smooth fractions in understanding the general structure of the noncommutative geometric invariants appearing in the heat kernel expansion. As an application of our results we obtain the a_4 term for noncommutative four tori which split as products of two tori. These four tori are not conformally flat and the a_4 term gives a first hint of the Riemann curvature and the higher dimensional modular structure. \n",

      "\n",
      "   The classical Cartan's structural equations show in a compact way the relation between a connection and its curvature, and reveals their geometric interpretation in terms of moving frames. In order to study the mathematical properties of singularities, we need to study the geometry of manifolds endowed on the tangent bundle with a symmetric bilinear form which is allowed to become degenerate. But if the fundamental tensor is allowed to be degenerate, there are some obstructions in constructing the geometric objects normally associated to the fundamental tensor. Also, local orthonormal frames and coframes no longer exist, as well as the metric connection and its curvature operator. This article shows that, if the fundamental tensor is radical stationary, we can construct in a canonical way geometric objects, determined only by the fundamental form, similar to the connection and curvature forms of Cartan. In particular, if the fundamental tensor is nondegenerate, we obtain the usual connection and curvature forms of Cartan. We write analogs of Cartan's first and second structural equations. As a byproduct we will find a compact version of the Koszul formula. \n",

This allows us to give a differential geometric proof of rigidity results obtained by M. Burger and A. Iozzi. We also define a new invariant associated to representations into PU(n,1) of nonuniform lattices in PU(1,1), and more generally of fundamental groups of orientable surfaces of finite topological type and negative Euler characteristic. We prove that this invariant is bounded by a constant depending only on the Euler characteristic of the surface and we give a complete characterization of representations with maximal invariant, thus generalizing the results of D. Toledo for uniform lattices. \n",

      "   The architecture of infinite structures with noncrystallographic symmetries can be modeled via aperiodic tilings, but a systematic construction method for finite structures with noncrystallographic symmetry at different radial levels is still lacking. We present here a group theoretical method for the construction of finite nested point set with noncrystallographic symmetry. Akin to the construction of quasicrystals, we embed a noncrystallographic group  into the point group  of a higher dimensional lattice and construct the chains of all containing subgroups. We determine the orbits of lattice points under such subgroups, and show that their projection into a lower dimensional invariant subspace consists of nested point sets with symmetry at each radial level. The number of different radial levels is bounded by the index of  in the subgroup of . In the case of icosahedral symmetry, we determine all subgroup chains explicitly and illustrate that these point sets in projection provide blueprints that approximate the organisation of simple viral capsids, encoding information on the structural organisation of capsid proteins and the genomic material collectively, based on two case studies. Contrary to the affine extensions previously introduced, these orbits endow virus architecture with an underlying finite group structure, which lends itself better for the modelling of its dynamic properties than its infinite dimensional counterpart. \n",

      "   This is the second in a series of papers studying the relationship between Rohlin's theorem and gauge theory. We discuss an invariant of a homology S^1 cross S^3 defined by Furuta and Ohta as an analogue of Casson's invariant for homology 3spheres. Our main result is a calculation of the FurutaOhta invariant for the mapping torus of a finiteorder diffeomorphism of a homology sphere. The answer is the equivariant Casson invariant (CollinSaveliev 2001) if the action has fixed points, and a version of the BoyerNicas (1990) invariant if the action is free. We deduce, for finiteorder mapping tori, the conjecture of Furuta and Ohta that their invariant reduces mod 2 to the Rohlin invariant of a manifold carrying a generator of the third homology group. Under some transversality assumptions, we show that the FurutaOhta invariant coincides with the Lefschetz number of the action on Floer homology. Comparing our two answers yields an example of a diffeomorphism acting trivially on the representation variety but nontrivially on Floer homology. \n",

We first assume the pull back Weitzenb\\\"{o}ck operator (defined in Section 2) of  bounded from below, and obtain an extrinsic lower bound for the first eigenvalue of HodgeLaplacian. As applications, we obtain some rigidity results and a homology sphere theorem. Second, when the pull back Weitzenb\\\"{o}ck operator of  bounded from both sides, we give a lower bound of the first eigenvalue by the Ricci curvature of  and some extrinsic geometry. As a consequence, we prove a weak Ejiri type theorem, that is, if the Ricci curvature bounded from below pointwisely by a function of the norm square of the mean curvature vector, then  is a homology sphere. In the end, we give an example to show that all the eigenvalue estimates and homology sphere theorems are optimal when  has constant curvature. \n",

The ODEs are continuous limits of the OSs, or conversely, the OSs are invariant discretizations of the ODEs. The invariant OSs are used to calculate numerical solutions of the invariant ODEs of order up to five. The solutions of the invariant numerical schemes are compared to numerical solutions obtained by standard RungeKutta methods and to exact solutions, when available.

Thus we generalize the results of Arinkin and Lysenko to the case of arbitrary number  of points. First, we construct separated Darboux coordinated in terms of the Hecke correspondences between moduli spaces. In this way we present a geometric interpretation of the Sklyanin formulas. In the second part of the paper, we construct Drinfeld's compactification of the initial data space and describe the compactifying divisor in terms of certain FHsheaves. Finally, we give a geometric presentation of the dynamics of the isomonodromic system in terms of deformations of the compactifying divisor and explain the role of apparent singularities for Fuchsian equations. To illustrate the results and methods, we give an example of the simplest isomonodromic system with four marked points known as the Painlev&#180;eVI system. \n",

      "   In the context of mathematical hydrodynamics, we consider the group theory structure which underlies the ABCflow introduced by Beltrami, Arnold and Childress. Beltrami equation is the eigenstate equation for the first order LaplaceBeltrami operator *d, which we solve by using harmonic analysis. Taking torus T^3 constructed as R^3/L, where L is a crystallographic lattice, we present a general algorithm to construct solutions of Beltrami equation which utilizes as main ingredient the orbits under the action of the point group P_L of threevectors in the momentum lattice L*. We introduce the new notion of a Universal Classifying Group GU_L which contains all crystallographic space groups as proper subgroups. We show that the *deigenfunctions are naturally arranged into irreducible representations of GU_L and by means of a systematic use of the branching rules with respect to various possible subgroups H of GU_L we search and find Beltrami fields with non trivial hidden symmetries. In the case of the cubic lattice the point group P_L is the proper octahedral group O_24 and the Universal Classifying Group is finite group G_1536 of order 1536 which we study in full detail deriving all of its 37 irreducible representations and the associated character table. We show that the O_24 orbits in the cubic lattice are arranged into 48 equivalence classes, the parameters of the corresponding Beltrami vector fields filling all the 37 irreducible representations of G_1536. In this way we obtain an exhaustive classification of all generalized ABCflows and of their hidden symmetries. We make several conceptual comments about the possible relation of ArnoldBeltrami flows with (supersymmetric) ChernSimons gauge theories. We also suggest linear generalizations of Beltrami equation to higher odddimensions that possibly make contact with Mtheory and the geometry of fluxcompactifications. \n",

      "   This paper is intended to describe twistors via the paravector model of Clifford algebras and to relate such description to conformal maps in the Clifford algebra over R(4,1), besides pointing out some applications of the pure spinor formalism. We construct twistors in Minkowski spacetime as algebraic spinors associated with the DiracClifford algebra, using one lower spacetime dimension than standard Clifford algebra formulations, since for this purpose the Clifford algebra over R{4,1} is also used to describe conformal maps, instead of R{2,4}. It is possible to identify the twistor fiber in four, six and eight dimensions, respectively, with the coset spaces SO(4)/(SU(2) x U(1)/Z_2) = CP1, SO(6)/(SU(3)x U(1)/Z_2) = CP3 and SO(8)/(Spin(6)x Spin(2)/Z_2). The last homogeneous space is closely related to the SO(8) spinor decomposition reserving SO(8) symmetry in type IIB superstring theory. Indeed, aside the IIB theory, there is no SO(8) spinor decomposition preserving SO(8) symmetry and, in this case, one can introduce distinct coordinates and conjugate momenta only if the Spin(8) symmetry is broken by a Spin(6) x Spin(2) subgroup of Spin(8). Also, it is reviewed how to generalize the Penrose flagpole, constructing a flagpole that is more general than the Penrose one, which arises in a particular case (Benn & Tucker description). We investigate the wellknown relation between this flagpole and the SO(2n)/U(n) twistorial structure, which emerges when one considers the set X of all totally isotropic subspaces of C{2n}, and an isomorphism from the set of pure spinors to X. Finally we point out some relations between twistors fibrations and the classification of compact homogeneous quaternionicKahler manifolds (the socalled Wolf spaces), and exceptional Lie structures. \n",

      "\n",
      "   Attached to both YangMills and General Relativity about Minkowski spacetime are distinguished gauge independent objects known as the onshell tree scattering amplitudes. We reinterpret and rigorously construct them as  minimal model brackets. This is based on formulating YM and GR as differential graded Lie algebras. Their minimal model brackets are then given by a sum of trivalent (cubic) Feynman tree graphs. The amplitudes are gauge independent when all internal lines are offshell, not merely up to  isomorphism, and we include a homological algebra proof of this fact. Using the homological perturbation lemma, we construct homotopies (propagators) that are optimal in bringing out the factorization of the residues of the amplitudes. Using a variant of Hartogs extension for singular varieties, we give a rigorous account of a recursive characterization of the amplitudes via their residues independent of their original definition in terms of Feynman graphs (this does neither involve socalled BCFW shifts nor conditions at infinity under such shifts). Roughly, the amplitude with  legs is the unique section of a sheaf on a variety of  complex momenta whose residues along a finite list of irreducible codimension one subvarieties (prime divisors) factor into amplitudes with less than  legs. The sheaf is a direct sum of rank one sheaves labeled by helicity signs. To emphasize that amplitudes are robust objects, we give a succinct list of properties that suffice for a dgLa so as to produce the YM and GR amplitudes respectively. \n",

      "   We elaborate on the recent proposal that intersection numbers of certain cohomology classes on the moduli space of genuszero Riemann surfaces with punctures compute treelevel scattering amplitudes in quantum field theories. The relevant cohomology classes are twisted by representations of the fundamental group that describes how punctures braid around each other on the Riemann surface, which can be used to link it to the space of kinematic invariants. Intersection numbers of said cohomology classes, whose representatives we call twisted forms, can be shown to fully localize on the boundaries of the moduli space, which are in onetoone map with Feynman diagrams. We prove that when twisted forms are logarithmic, their intersection numbers have a simple expansion in terms of trivalent Feynman diagrams allowing only for massless propagators on the internal and external lines. For physical applications one also needs to study nonlogarithmic forms as they are responsible for propagation of massive states. We utilize the natural fibre bundle structure of the moduli space, which allows for a direct access to the boundaries, to introduce recursion relations for intersection numbers that \"integrate out\" puncturebypuncture. The resulting recursion involves only linear algebra of certain matrices describing braiding properties of the moduli space and evaluating onedimensional residues, thus paving a way for explicit analytic computations of scattering amplitudes. Together with the previous reformulation of the treelevel Smatrix of string theory in terms of twisted forms, the results of this work complete a unified geometric framework for studying scattering amplitudes from genuszero Riemann surfaces. We show that a web of dualities between different homology and cohomology groups allows for deriving a host of identities among various types of amplitudes computed from the moduli space. \n",

      "   ChernSimons theories, which are topological quantum field theories, provide a field theoretic framework for the study of knots and links in three dimensions. These are rare examples of quantum field theories which can be exactly and explicitly solved. Expectation values of Wilson link operators yield a class of link invariants, the simplest of them is the famous Jones polynomial. Other invariants are more powerful than that of Jones. These new invariants are sensitive to the chirality of all knots at least upto ten crossing number unlike those of Jones which are blind to the chirality of some of them. However, all these invariants are still not good enough to distinguish a class of knots called mutants. These link invariants can be alternately obtained from two dimensional vertex models. The matrix of such a model in a particular limit of the spectral parameter provides a representation of the braid group. This in turn is used to construct the link invariants. Exploiting theorems of Lickorish and Wallace and also those of Kirby, Fenn and Rourke which relate threemanifolds to surgeries on framed links, these link invariants in  can also be used to construct threemanifold invariants. \n",

      "\n",
      "   We describe a method for exactly diagonalizing clean dimensional lattice systems of independent fermions subject to arbitrary boundary conditions in one direction, as well as systems composed of two bulks meeting at a planar interface. Our method builds on the generalized Bloch theorem  and the fact that the bulkboundary separation of the Schrodinger equation is compatible with a partial Fourier transform operation. Bulk equations may display unusual features because they are relative eigenvalue problems for nonHermitian, bulkprojected Hamiltonians. Nonetheless, they admit a rich symmetry analysis that can simplify considerably the structure of energy eigenstates, often allowing a solution in fully analytical form. We illustrate our extension of the generalized Bloch theorem to multicomponent systems by determining the exact Andreev bound states for a simple SNS junction. We then analyze the Creutz ladder model, by way of a conceptual bridge from one to higher dimensions. Upon introducing a new Gaussian duality transformation that maps the Creutz ladder to a system of two Majorana chains, we show how the model provides a first example of a shortrange chiral topological insulator hosting topological zero modes with a powerlaw profile. Additional applications include the complete analytical diagonalization of graphene ribbons with both zigzagbearded and armchair boundary conditions, and the analytical determination of the edge modes in a chiral  twodimensional topological superconductor. Lastly, we revisit the phenomenon of Majorana flat bands and anomalous bulkboundary correspondence in a twoband gapless wave topological superconductor. We analyze the equilibrium Josephson response of the system, showing how the presence of Majorana flat bands implies a substantial enhancement in the periodic supercurrent. \n",

      " [ Cosine Similarity= 0.911 ]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "   In 1870, R. Clausius found the virial theorem which amounts to introduce the trace of the stress tensor when studying the foundations of thermodynamics, as a way to relate the absolute temperature of an ideal gas to the mean kinetic energy of its molecules. In 1901, H. Poincar{\\'e} introduced a duality principle in analytical mechanics in order to study lagrangians invariant under the action of a Lie group of transformations. In 1909, the brothers E. and F. Cosserat discovered another approach for studying the same problem though using quite different equations. In 1916, H. Weyl considered again the same problem for the conformal group of transformations, obtaining at the same time the Maxwell equations and an additional specific equation also involving the trace of the impulsionenergy tensor. Finally, having in mind the spacetime formulation of electromagnetism and the MaurerCartan equations for Lie groups, gauge theory has been created by C.N. Yang and R.L. Mills in 1954 as a way to introduce in physics the differential geometric methods available at that time, independently of any group action, contrary to all the previous approaches. The main purpose of this paper is to revisit the mathematical foundations of thermodynamics and gauge theory by using new differential geometric methods coming from the formal theory of systems of partial differential equations and Lie pseudogroups, mostly developped by D.C Spencer and coworkers around 1970. In particular, we justify and extend the virial theorem, showing that the Clausius/Cosserat/Maxwell/Weyl equations are nothing else but the formal adjoint of the Spencer operator appearing in the canonical Spencer sequence for the conformal group of spacetime and are thus totally dependent on the group action. The duality principle also appeals to the formal adjoint of a linear differential operator used in differential geometry and to the extension modules used in homological algebra. \n",

One of these expressions is a generalisation of Ram's formula for irreducible Hecke characters and uses cylindric broken rim hook tableaux. We show that the latter are in bijection with socalled `ice configurations' on a cylindrical square lattice, which define the asymmetric sixvertex model in statistical mechanics. A key ingredient of our construction is an extension of the bosonfermion correspondence to Hecke algebras and employing the latter we find new expressions for Jing's vertex operators of HallLittlewood functions in terms of the sixvertex transfer matrices on the infinite planar lattice. \n",

For a given moduli space manifold, we describe the thermodynamic geometry away from attractor fixed point configurations with and without higher derivative corrections. From the notion of embedding theory, the present investigation offers a set of generalized complex structures and associated properties of differentiable manifolds. We have shown that the convexity of arbitrary entropy function can be realized in an extended subfield of the eigenvalues of the Hessian  of Sen entropy function. Thus, the spectra of  are analyzed by defining Krull of the corresponding semisymplectic algebras. From the framework of commutative algebra, we find that the convex hull of the eigenvalues defines a generalized spectrum of . The corresponding complexification is established for finitely many eigenvalues of . For the minimally extended subfield, we show that the spectrum of  reduces to the thermodynamic type spectra, at the attractor fixed point(s). In the limit of  near horizon geometry, the attractor flow analysis offers the stability of arbitrary extremal black hole. From the perspective of string compactifications, our investigation implies a set of deformed Sduality transformations, which contain both the duality invariant charges and monodromy invariant parameters.

This fact serves as a prelude to our main results, which concern topological completions of two inductive limit groups built from finite unitary groups. We show that in this case, coadjointinvariant measures are linked to some new branching graphs.

      "   We introduce logarithmic Picard algebroids, a natural class of Lie algebroids adapted to a simple normal crossings divisor on a smooth projective variety. We show that such algebroids are classified by a subspace of the de Rham cohomology of the divisor complement determined by its mixed Hodge structure. We then solve the prequantization problem, showing that under the appropriate integrality condition, a log Picard algebroid is the Lie algebroid of symmetries of what is called a meromorphic line bundle, a generalization of the usual notion of line bundle in which the fibres degenerate along the divisor. We give a geometric description of such bundles and establish a classification theorem for them, showing that they correspond to a subgroup of the holomorphic line bundles on the divisor complement. Importantly, these holomorphic line bundles need not be algebraic. Finally, we provide concrete methods for explicitly constructing examples of meromorphic line bundles, such as for a smooth cubic divisor in the projective plane. \n",

The arguments are more conceptual than the one in our previous paper, but require proving Holder continuity of the infinitesimal conjugacy (a new result, of independent interest) and using spaces of bounded pvariation. The first new proof gives differentiability of higher order if f_t is smooth enough and stays in the topological class of f_0 and if the observable smooth enough (a new result). In addition, this proof does not require any information on the decomposition of the SRB measure into regular and singular terms, making it potentially amenable to extensions to higher dimensions. The second new proof allows us to recover the linear response formula (i.e., the formula for the derivative at 0) obtained in our previous paper and gives additional information on this formula. \n",

This result makes questions about the associated cohomology groups and spectral sequences easy to understand. We describe a notion of `universal' quasiisomorphism, investigate the behaviour of the decomposition under tensor product and compute the Grothendieck ring of the category of bounded double complexes over a field with finite cohomologies up to such quasiisomorphism (and some variants). Applying the theory to the double complexes of smooth complex valued forms on compact complex manifolds, we obtain a Poincar\\'e duality for higher pages of the Fr\\\"olicher spectral sequence, construct a functorial threespace decomposition of the middle cohomology, give an example of a map between compact complex manifolds which does not respect the Hodge filtration strictly, compute the BottChern and Aeppli cohomology for CalabiEckmann manifolds, introduce new numerical bimeromorphic invariants, show that the nonK\\\"ahlerness degrees are not bimeromorphic invariants in dimensions higher than three and that the lemma and some related properties are bimeromorphic invariants if, and only if, they are stable under restriction to complex submanifolds. \n",

      "   The aim of this work is to complete our program on the quantization of connections on arbitrary principal U(1)bundles over globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifolds. In particular, we show that one can assign via a covariant functor to any such bundle an algebra of observables which separates gauge equivalence classes of connections. The C*algebra we construct generalizes the usual CCRalgebras since, contrary to the standard fieldtheoretic models, it is based on a presymplectic Abelian group instead of a symplectic vector space. We prove a nogo theorem according to which neither this functor, nor any of its quotients, satisfies the strict axioms of general local covariance. As a byproduct, we prove that a morphism violates the locality axiom if and only if a certain induced morphism of cohomology groups is noninjective. We then show that fixing any principal U(1)bundle, there exists a suitable category of subbundles for which a quotient of our functor yields a quantum field theory in the sense of Haag and Kastler. We shall provide a physical interpretation of this feature and we obtain some new insights concerning electric charges in locally covariant quantum field theory. \n",

We describe the formal group and its logarithm in terms of representations of . We introduce onedimensional representations of a Hopf algebra. We give series of examples of such representations motivated by wellknown topological and algebraic results. We define and study the divided difference operators on an integral domain. We discuss certain important examples of such operators arising from analysis, representation theory, and noncommutative algebra. We give a special attention to the division operators by a noninvertible element of a ring. We give new general constructions of associative product structures (not necessarily commutative) using the divided difference operators. As application, we describe new classes of associative products in the complex cobordism theory. \n",

      "\n",
      "   The principal goal of the paper is to apply the approach inspired by the theory of integrable systems to construct explicit sections of line bundles over the combinatorial model of the moduli space of pointed Riemann surfaces based on JenkinsStrebel differentials. The line bundles are tensor products of the determinants of the Hodge or Prym vector bundles with the standard tautological line bundles  and the sections are constructed in terms of tau functions. The combinatorial model is interpreted as the real slice of a complex analytic moduli space of quadratic differentials where the phase of each taufunction provides a section of a circle bundle. The phase of the ratio of the Prym and Hodge tau functions gives a section of the circle bundle.   By evaluating the increment of the phase around codimension  subcomplexes, we identify the Poincar\\'e\\ dual cycles to the Chern classes of the corresponding line bundles: they are expressed explicitly as combination of Witten's cycle  and Kontsevich's boundary. This provides combinatorial analogues of Mumford's relations on  and Penner's relations in the hyperbolic combinatorial model. The free homotopy classes of loops around  are interpreted as pentagon moves while those of loops around Kontsevich's boundary as combinatorial Dehn twists.   Throughout the paper we exploit the classical description of the combinatorial model in terms of JenkinsStrebel differentials, parametrized in terms of {\\it homological coordinates}; we also show that they provide Darboux coordinates for the symplectic structure introduced by Kontsevich. We also express the latter in clear geometric terms as the intersection pairing in the odd homology of the canonical double cover. \n",

The differentiable version of cyclic cohomology is associated to the algebra of transverse differential operators on that groupoid, which is shown to carry an intrinsic Hopf algebraic structure. We establish a canonical isomorphism between the periodic Hopf cyclic cohomology of this extended Hopf algebra and the GelfandFuchs cohomology of the Lie algebra of formal vector fields. We then show that this isomorphism can be explicitly implemented at the cochain level, by a cochain map constructed out of a fixed torsionfree linear connection. This allows the direct treatment of the index formula for the hypoelliptic signature operator  representing the diffeomorphism invariant transverse fundamental homology class of an oriented manifold  in the general case, when this operator is constructed by means of an arbitrary coupling connection. \n",

      "   Let M be a closed manifold and let CL(M) be the algebra of classical pseudodifferential operators. The aim of this note is to classify trace functionals on the subspaces CL^a(M) of CL(M) of operators of order a. CL^a(M) is a CL^0(M)module for any real a; it is an algebra only if a is a nonpositive integer. Therefore, it turns out to be useful to introduce the notions of pretrace and hypertrace. Our main result gives a complete classification of pre and hypertraces on CL^a(M) for any real a, as well as the traces on CL^a(M) if a is a nonpositive integer. We also extend these results to classical pseudodifferential operators acting on sections of a vector bundle.   As a byproduct we give a new proof of the wellknown uniqueness results for the GuilleminWodzicki residue trace and for the KontsevichVishik canonical trace. The novelty of our approach lies in the calculation of the cohomology groups of homogeneous and logpolyhomogeneous differential forms on a symplectic cone. This allows to give an extremely simple proof of a generalization of a Theorem of Guillemin about the representation of homogeneous functions as sums of Poisson brackets. \n",

      "   We consider the moduli space of holomorphic principal bundles for reductive Lie groups over Riemann surfaces (possibly with boundaries) and equipped with meromorphic connections. We associate to this space a pointwise notion of quantum spectral curve whose generalized periods define a new set of moduli. We define homology cycles and differential forms of the quantum spectral curve, allowing to derive quantum analogs of the formcycle duality and Riemann bilinear identities of classical geometry. A taufunction is introduced for this system in the form of a thetaseries and in such a way that the variations of its coefficients with respect to moduli, isomonodromic or not, can be computed as quantum period integrals. This lays new grounds to relate our study to that of integrable hierarchies, isomonodromic deformation of meromorphic connections and nonperturbative topological string theory. In turn, we define amplitudes on the quantum spectral curve which have an interpretation in conformal field theory when the Lie algebra is assumed to be simplylaced: they coincide with correlation functions involving twisted chiral fields of an affine Lie algebra at level one. The singularities at the punctures are interpreted as primary fields of the associated Casimir Walgebra. The amplitudes are moreover related by Wconstraints, socalled loop equations, allowing one to compute recursively a certain asymptotic expansion of the taufunction, namely the one corresponding both to the heavycharge regime of conformal field theory and to the weakcoupling regime of topological string theory. \n",

We recall that, up to isomorphism in the Grothendieck group K_0(D), the ideals of D are classified by the Picard group of X: there is a natural fibration \\gamma: J(D) \\to Pic(X), whose fibres are the stable isomorphism classes of ideals of D (see ). In this paper, we refine this classification by describing the fibres of \\gamma in terms of finitedimensional algebraic varieties C_n(X, I), which we call the (generalized) CalogeroMoser spaces. We define these varieties as representation varieties of deformed preprojective algebras over a certain extension of the ring of regular functions on .

      "\n",
      "   We present a generalization of Minkowski's classic theorem on the reconstruction of tetrahedra from algebraic data to homogeneously curved spaces. Euclidean notions such as the normal vector to a face are replaced by LeviCivita holonomies around each of the tetrahedron's faces. This allows the reconstruction of both spherical and hyperbolic tetrahedra within a unified framework. A new type of hyperbolic simplex is introduced in order for all the sectors encoded in the algebraic data to be covered. Generalizing the phase space of shapes associated to flat tetrahedra leads to group valued moment maps and quasiPoisson spaces. These discrete geometries provide a natural arena for considering the quantization of gravity including a cosmological constant. A concrete realization of this is provided by the relation with the spinnetwork states of loop quantum gravity. This work therefore provides a bottomup justification for the emergence of deformed gauge symmetries and quantum groups in 3+1 dimensional covariant loop quantum gravity in the presence of a cosmological constant. \n",

      "   In the present note, we uncover a remarkable connection between the length of periodic orbit of a classical particle enclosed in a class of 2dimensional planar billiards and the energy of a quantum particle confined to move in an identical region with infinitely high potential wall on the boundary. We observe that the quantum energy spectrum of the particle is in exact onetoone correspondence with the spectrum of the amplitude squares of the periodic orbits of a classical particle for the class of integrable billiards considered. We have established the results by geometric constructions and exploiting the method of reflective tiling and folding of classical trajectories. We have further extended the method to 3dimensional billiards for which exact analytical results are scarcely available  exploiting the geometric construction, we determine the exact energy spectra of two new tetrahedral domains which we believe are integrable. We test the veracity of our results by comparing them with numerical results. \n",

      "   In this article we employ a simple nonrelativistic model to describe the low energy excitation of graphene. The model is based on a deformation of the Heisenberg algebra which makes the commutator of momenta proportional to the pseudospin. We solve the Landau problem for the resulting Hamiltonian which reduces, in the large mass limit while keeping fixed the Fermi velocity, to the usual linear one employed to describe these excitations as massless Dirac fermions. This model, extended to negative mass, allows to reproduce the leading terms in the low energy expansion of the dispersion relation for both nearest and nexttonearest neighbor interactions. Taking into account the contributions of both Dirac points, the resulting Hall conductivity, evaluated with a function approach, is consistent with the anomalous integer quantum Hall effect found in graphene. Moreover, when considered in first order perturbation theory, it is shown that the nexttoleading term in the interaction between nearest neighbor produces no modifications in the spectrum of the model while an electric field perpendicular to the magnetic field produces just a rigid shift of this spectrum.

      " [ Cosine Similarity= 0.873 ]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "   We question the emergence of a minimal length in quantum spacetime, comparing two notions that appeared at various points in the literature: on the one side, the quantum length as the spectrum of an operator L in the Doplicher Fredenhagen Roberts (DFR) quantum spacetime, as well as in the canonical noncommutative spacetime; on the other side, Connes' spectral distance in noncommutative geometry. Although on the Euclidean space the two notions merge into the one of geodesic distance, they yield distinct results in the noncommutative framework. In particular on the Moyal plane, the quantum length is bounded above from zero while the spectral distance can take any real positive value, including infinity. We show how to solve this discrepancy by doubling the spectral triple. This leads us to introduce a modified quantum length d'_L, which coincides exactly with the spectral distance d_D on the set of states of optimal localization. On the set of eigenstates of the quantum harmonic oscillator  together with their translations  d'_L and d_D coincide asymptotically, both in the high energy and large translation limits. At small energy, we interpret the discrepancy between d'_L and d_D as two distinct ways of integrating the line element on a quantum space. This leads us to propose an equation for a geodesic on the Moyal plane. \n",

By considering an even number, , of waveguides, we derive asymptotic expressions for solutions in which the bulk of the light intensity is concentrated as a solitonlike pulses confined to a single waveguide. The leading order terms obtained are in very good agreement with results of numerical computations. Furthermore, as in the model without temporal dispersion, when the twist parameter, , is given by , these standing waves exhibit optical suppression, in which a single waveguide remains unexcited, to leading order. Spectral computations and numerical evolution experiments suggest that these standing wave solutions are stable for values of the coupling parameter less than a critical value, at which point a spectral instability results from the collision of an internal eigenvalue with the eigenvalues at the origin. This critical value has a maximum when . \n",

      "   In quantum manybody systems, the existence of a spectral gap above the ground state has farreaching consequences. In this paper, we discuss \"finitesize\" criteria for having a spectral gap in frustrationfree spin systems and their applications. We extend a criterion that was originally developed for periodic systems by Knabe and GossetMozgunov to systems with a boundary. Our finitesize criterion says that if the spectral gaps at linear system size  exceed an explicit threshold of order , then the whole system is gapped. The criterion takes into account both \"bulk gaps\" and \"edge gaps\" of the finite system in a precise way. The  scaling is robust: it holds in 1D and 2D systems, on arbitrary lattices and with arbitrary finiterange interactions. One application of our results is to give a rigorous foundation to the folklore that 2D frustrationfree models cannot host chiral edge modes (whose finitesize spectral gap would scale like ). \n",

      "   Transition states or quantum states of zero energy appear at the boundary between the discrete part of the spectrum of negative energies and the continuum part of positive energy states. As such, transition states can be regarded as a limiting case of a bound state with vanishing binding energy, emerging for a particular set of critical potential parameters. In this work we study the properties of these critical parameters for short range central potentials. To this end we develop two exact methods and also utilize the first and second order WKB approximations. Using these methods we have calculated the critical parameters for several widely used central potentials.   The general analytic expressions for the asymptotic representations of the critical parameters were derived for cases where either the orbital quantum number  or the number  of bound states approaches infinity.   The above mathematical models enable us to answer the following physical (quantum mechanical) questions: i) what is the number of bound states for a given central potential and given orbital quantum number ; ii) what is the maximum value of  which can provide a bound state for the given central potential; iii) what is the order of energy levels for the given form of the central potential.   It is revealed that the ordering of energy levels depends on the potential singularity at the origin. \n",

      "   Two fundamental models in plasma physics are given by the VlasovMaxwellBoltzmann system and the compressible EulerMaxwell system which both capture the complex dynamics of plasmas under the selfconsistent electromagnetic interactions at the kinetic and fluid levels, respectively. It has remained a longstanding open problem to rigorously justify the hydrodynamic limit from the former to the latter as the Knudsen number  tends to zero. In this paper we give an affirmative answer to the problem for smooth solutions to both systems near constant equilibrium in the whole space in case when only the dynamics of electrons is taken into account. The explicit rate of convergence in  over an almost global time interval is also obtained for wellprepared data. For the proof, one of main difficulties occurs to the cubic growth of large velocities due to the action of the classical transport operator on local Maxwellians and we develop new dependent energy estimates basing on the macromicro decomposition to characterize the asymptotic limit in the compressible setting. \n",

      "   The purpose of this paper is twofold. In the first part, we provide a new proof of the global existence of the solutions to the VlasovMaxwell system arising from small data. Our approach relies on vector field methods, together with the GlasseyStrauss decomposition of the electromagnetic field, and does not require any compact support assumption on the initial data. Contrary to previous works on Vlasov systems in dimension 3, we do not modify the linear commutators and avoid then many technical difficulties.   In the second part of this paper, we prove a modified scattering result for these solutions. More precisely, we obtain that the electromagnetic field has a radiation field along future null infinity and approaches, for large time, a smooth solution to the vacuum Maxwell equations. As for the VlasovPoisson system, in constrast, the distribution function converges to a new smooth density function along modifications of the characteristics of the free relativistic transport equation. In order to define these logarithmic corrections, we identify an effective asymptotic Lorentz force. \n",

Our derivation is based on a martingale method and a perturbed test function expansion. This requires the electromagnetic field to be a spacetime random field.   The main mathematical tool in the derivation of the kinetic limit is the matrixvalued Wigner transform of the vectorvalued Dirac solution. The major novelty compared to the scalar (Schr\\\"odinger) case is the proof of convergence of crossmodes to 0 weakly in space and almost surely in probability. The propagating modes are shown to converge in an appropriate strong sense to their deterministic limit. \n",

      "   We study the classical RajeevRanken model, a Hamiltonian system with three degrees of freedom describing nonlinear continuous waves in a 1+1dimensional nilpotent scalar field theory pseudodual to the SU(2) principal chiral model. While it loosely resembles the Neumann and Kirchhoff models, its equations may be viewed as the Euler equations for a centrally extended Euclidean algebra. The model has a Lax pair and rmatrix leading to four generically independent conserved quantities in involution, two of which are Casimirs. Their level sets define fourdimensional symplectic leaves on which the system is Liouville integrable. On each of these leaves, the common level sets of the remaining conserved quantities are shown, in general, to be 2tori. The nongeneric level sets can only be horn tori, circles and points. They correspond to measure zero subsets where the conserved quantities develop relations and solutions degenerate from elliptic to hyperbolic, circular or constant functions. A geometric construction allows us to realize each common level set as a bundle with base determined by the roots of a cubic polynomial. A dynamics is defined on the union of each type of level set, with the corresponding phase manifolds expressed as bundles over spaces of conserved quantities. Interestingly, topological transitions in energy hypersurfaces are found to occur at energies corresponding to horn tori, which support purely homoclinic orbits. The dynamics on each horn torus is nonHamiltonian, but expressed as a gradient flow. Finally, we discover a family of actionangle variables for the system that apply away from horn tori. \n",

      "   We consider determinantal point processes on a compact complex manifold X in the limit of many particles. The correlation kernels of the processes are the Bergman kernels associated to a a high power of a given Hermitian holomorphic line bundle L over X. The empirical measure on X of the process, describing the particle locations, converges in probability towards the pluripotential equilibrium measure, expressed in term of the MongeAmp\\`ere operator. The asymptotics of the corresponding fluctuations in the bulk are shown to be asymptotically normal and described by a Gaussian free field and applies to test functions (linear statistics) which are merely Lipschitz continuous. Moreover, a scaling limit of the correlation functions in the bulk is shown to be universal and expressed in terms of (the higher dimensional analog of) the Ginibre ensemble. This geometric setting applies in particular to normal random matrix ensembles, the two dimensional Coulomb gas, free fermions in a strong magnetic field and multivariate orthogonal polynomials. \n",

      "\n",
      "   We present a detailed analysis of the classical DickeJaynesCummingsGaudin integrable model, which describes a system of  spins coupled to a single harmonic oscillator. We focus on the singularities of the vectorvalued moment map whose components are the  mutually commuting conserved Hamiltonians. The level sets of the moment map corresponding to singular values may be viewed as degenerate and often singular ArnoldLiouville torii. A particularly interesting example of singularity corresponds to unstable equilibrium points where the rank of the moment map is zero, or singular lines where the rank is one. The corresponding level sets can be described as a reunion of smooth strata of various dimensions. Using the Lax representation, the associated spectral curve and the separated variables, we show how to construct explicitely these level sets. A main difficulty in this task is to select, among possible complex solutions, the physically admissible family for which all the spin components are real. We obtain explicit solutions to this problem in the rank zero and one cases. Remarkably this corresponds exactly to solutions obtained previously by Yuzbashyan and whose geometrical meaning is therefore revealed. These solutions can be described as multimode solitons which can live on strata of arbitrary large dimension. In these solitons, the energy initially stored in some excited spins (or atoms) is transferred at finite times to the oscillator mode (photon) and eventually comes back into the spin subsystem. But their multimode character is reflected by a large diversity in their shape, which is controlled by the choice of the initial condition on the stratum. \n",

      "   In this paper, we adapt the wellknown \\emph{local} uniqueness results of BorgMarchenko type in the inverse problems for one dimensional Schr{\\\"o}dinger equation to prove \\emph{local} uniqueness results in the setting of inverse \\emph{metric} problems. More specifically, we consider a class of spherically symmetric manifolds having two asymptotically hyperbolic ends and study the scattering properties of massless Dirac waves evolving on such manifolds. Using the spherical symmetry of the model, the stationary scattering is encoded by a countable family of onedimensional Dirac equations. This allows us to define the corresponding transmission coefficients  and reflection coefficients  and  of a Dirac wave having a fixed energy  and angular momentum . For instance, the reflection coefficients  correspond to the scattering experiment in which a wave is sent from the \\emph{left} end in the remote past and measured in the same left end in the future. The main result of this paper is an inverse uniqueness result local in nature. Namely, we prove that for a fixed , the knowledge of the reflection coefficients  (resp. )  up to a precise error term of the form  with   determines the manifold in a neighbourhood of the left (resp. right) end, the size of this neighbourhood depending on the magnitude  of the error term.

      "\n",
      "   For the Newtonian (gravitational) body problem in the Euclidean dimensional space, , the simplest possible periodic solutions are provided by circular relative equilibria, (RE) for short, namely solutions in which each body rigidly rotates about the center of mass and the configuration of the whole system is constant in time and central (or, more generally, balanced) configuration. For , the only possible (RE) are planar, but in dimension four it is possible to get truly four dimensional (RE).   A classical problem in celestial mechanics aims at relating the (in)stability properties of a (RE) to the index properties of the central (or, more generally, balanced) configuration generating it. In this paper, we provide sufficient conditions that imply the spectral instability of planar and nonplanar (RE) in  generated by a central configuration, thus answering some of the questions raised in \\cite{Moe14}. As a corollary, we retrieve a classical result of Hu and Sun  on the linear instability of planar (RE) whose generating central configuration is nondegenerate and has odd Morse index, and fix a gap in the statement of \\cite{BJP14} about the spectral instability of planar (RE) whose (possibly degenerate) generating central configuration has odd Morse index.   The key ingredients are a new formula of independent interest that allows to compute the spectral flow of a path of symmetric matrices having degenerate starting point, and a symplectic decomposition of the phase space of the linearized Hamiltonian system along a given (RE) which is inspired by Meyer and Schmidt's planar decomposition  and which allows us to rule out the uninteresting part of the dynamics corresponding to the translational and (partially) to the rotational symmetry of the problem. \n",

      " [ Cosine Similarity= 0.915 ]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "   In this article we extend several foundational results of the theory of complete minimal surfaces of finite index in the Euclidean space to minimal surfaces in asymptotically flat manifolds and, more generally, to marginally outertrapped surfaces in initial data sets of General Relativity. We show that if an asymptotically flat 3manifold (M,g) of nonnegative scalar curvature contains a noncompact, properly embedded minimal surface which is stable and has quadratic area growth, then it is isometric to the flat R^{3}. This implies, for instance, that in presence of a positive ADM mass any sequence of solutions to the Plateau problem with diverging boundaries can never have uniform height bounds, even at a single point. The proof of this theorem is based on a characterization of finite index minimal surfaces, on classical infinitesimal rigidity results by FischerColbrie and Schoen and on the positive mass theorem by SchoenYau. More specifically, we also show that a complete minimal surface of finite index inside an asymptotically flat 3manifold has finitely many ends and each of these is a graph of a function that has a suitable expansion at infinity, in analogy with a classical result by Schoen for Euclidean spaces. In addition, we prove that a noncompact stable MOTS in an initial data set (M,g,k) is conformally diffeomorphic to either the plane C or to the cylinder A and in the latter case infinitesimal rigidity holds. If the data have harmonic asymptotics, the former case is also proven to be globally rigid in the sense that the presence of a stable MOTS forces an isometric embedding of (M,g,k) in the Minkowski spacetime (\\mathbb{M},\\eta) as a spacelike slice. \n",

      "   A major open conjecture on the behavior of optimal paths in random graphs in the strong disorder regime, formulated by statistical physicists, and supported by a large amount of numerical evidence over the last decade  is as follows: for a large class of random graph models with degree exponent , the distance between two typical points on the minimal spanning tree (MST) on the giant component in the supercritical regime scales like . In this paper we give the first rigorous proof of this conjecture.   We consider a supercritical inhomogeneous random graph model with degree exponent  that is closely related to Aldous's multiplicative coalescent, and show that the MST constructed by assigning i.i.d. continuous weights to the edges in its giant component, endowed with the tree distance scaled by , converges in distribution with respect to the GromovHausdorff topology to a random compact real tree. Further, almost surely, every point in this limiting space either has degree one (leaf), or two, or infinity (hub), both the set of leaves and the set of hubs are dense in this space, and the Minkowski dimension of this space equals .   The multiplicative coalescent, in an asymptotic sense, describes the evolution of the component sizes of various nearcritical random graph processes. We expect the limiting spaces in this paper to be the candidates for the scaling limit of the MST constructed for a wide array of other heavytailed random graph models. \n",

      "\n",
      "   We consider a region of Minkowski spacetime bounded either by one or by two parallel, infinitely extended plates orthogonal to a spatial direction and a real KleinGordon field satisfying Dirichlet boundary conditions. We quantize these two systems within the algebraic approach to quantum field theory using the socalled functional formalism. As a first step we construct a suitable unital *algebra of observables whose generating functionals are characterized by a labelling space which is at the same time optimal and separating and fulfils the Flocality property. Subsequently we give a definition for these systems of Hadamard states and we investigate explicit examples. In the case of a single plate, it turns out that one can build algebraic states via a pullback of those on the whole Minkowski spacetime, moreover inheriting from them the Hadamard property. When we consider instead two plates, algebraic states can be put in correspondence with those on flat spacetime via the socalled method of images, which we translate to the algebraic setting. For a massless scalar field we show that this procedure works perfectly for a large class of quasifree states including the Poincar\\'e vacuum and KMS states. Eventually Wick polynomials are introduced. Contrary to the Minkowski case, the extended algebras, built in globally hyperbolic subregions can be collected in a global counterpart only after a suitable deformation which is expressed locally in terms of a *isomorphism. As a last step, we construct explicitly the twopoint function and the regularized energy density, showing, moreover, that the outcome is consistent with the standard results of the Casimir effect. \n",

      " [ Cosine Similarity= 0.914 ]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "   Recent studies have established that, in addition to the wellknown kicked Harper model (KHM), an onresonance double kicked rotor model (ORDKR) also has Hofstadter's butterfly Floquet spectrum, with strong resemblance to the standard Hofstadter's spectrum that is a paradigm in studies of the integer quantum Hall effect. Earlier it was shown that the quasienergy spectra of these two dynamical models (i) can exactly overlap with each other if an effective Planck constant takes irrational multiples of 2*pi and (ii) will be different if the same parameter takes rational multiples of 2*pi. This work makes some detailed comparisons between these two models, with an effective Planck constant given by 2*pi M/N, where M and N are coprime and odd integers. It is found that the ORDKR spectrum (with two periodic kicking sequences having the same kick strength) has one flat band and  nonflat bands whose largest width decays in power law as K to the power of N+2, where K is a kicking strength parameter. The existence of a flat band is strictly proven and the power law scaling, numerically checked for a number of cases, is also analytically proven for a threeband case. By contrast, the KHM does not have any flat band and its band width scales linearly with K. This is shown to result in dramatic differences in dynamical behavior, such as transient (but extremely long) dynamical localization in ORDKR, which is absent in KHM. Finally, we show that despite these differences, there exist simple extensions of KHM and ORDKR (upon introducing an additional periodic phase parameter) such that the resulting extended KHM and ORDKR are actually topologically equivalent, i.e., they yield exactly the same Floquetband Chern numbers and display topological phase transitions at the same kick strengths. A theoretical derivation of this topological equivalence is provided. \n",

Furthermore, we prove that asymptotically the vorticity decompose itself in a dominant stationary part on the parabolic scale  and corrections of order , while the velocity field decompose itself in a dominant stationary part in form of an explicit multiscale expansion on the scales  and  and corrections decaying at least like . The asymptotic fields are made of linear combinations of universal functions with coefficients depending mildly on the boundary data.

      "   Consider a nontrivial solution to a semilinear elliptic system of first order with smooth coefficients defined over an dimensional manifold. Assume the operator has the strong unique continuation property. We show that the zero set of the solution is contained in a countable union of smooth dimensional submanifolds. Hence it is countably rectifiable and its Hausdorff dimension is at most . Moreover, it has locally finite dimensional Hausdorff measure. We show by example that every real number between 0 and  actually occurs as the Hausdorff dimension (for a suitable choice of operator). We also derive results for scalar elliptic equations of second order. \n",

      "\n",
      "   We consider determinantal point processes on a compact complex manifold X in the limit of many particles. The correlation kernels of the processes are the Bergman kernels associated to a a high power of a given Hermitian holomorphic line bundle L over X. The empirical measure on X of the process, describing the particle locations, converges in probability towards the pluripotential equilibrium measure, expressed in term of the MongeAmp\\`ere operator. The asymptotics of the corresponding fluctuations in the bulk are shown to be asymptotically normal and described by a Gaussian free field and applies to test functions (linear statistics) which are merely Lipschitz continuous. Moreover, a scaling limit of the correlation functions in the bulk is shown to be universal and expressed in terms of (the higher dimensional analog of) the Ginibre ensemble. This geometric setting applies in particular to normal random matrix ensembles, the two dimensional Coulomb gas, free fermions in a strong magnetic field and multivariate orthogonal polynomials. \n",

First, the eigenfunctions are close to plane waves  at the high energy region. Second, the isoenergetic curves in the space of momenta  corresponding to these eigenfunctions have a form of slightly distorted circles with holes (Cantor type structure). A new method of multiscale analysis in the momentum space is developed to prove these results.   The result is based on the previous paper  on quasiperiodic polyharmonic operator , .

      " [ Cosine Similarity= 0.923 ]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "   In this article we extend several foundational results of the theory of complete minimal surfaces of finite index in the Euclidean space to minimal surfaces in asymptotically flat manifolds and, more generally, to marginally outertrapped surfaces in initial data sets of General Relativity. We show that if an asymptotically flat 3manifold (M,g) of nonnegative scalar curvature contains a noncompact, properly embedded minimal surface which is stable and has quadratic area growth, then it is isometric to the flat R^{3}. This implies, for instance, that in presence of a positive ADM mass any sequence of solutions to the Plateau problem with diverging boundaries can never have uniform height bounds, even at a single point. The proof of this theorem is based on a characterization of finite index minimal surfaces, on classical infinitesimal rigidity results by FischerColbrie and Schoen and on the positive mass theorem by SchoenYau. More specifically, we also show that a complete minimal surface of finite index inside an asymptotically flat 3manifold has finitely many ends and each of these is a graph of a function that has a suitable expansion at infinity, in analogy with a classical result by Schoen for Euclidean spaces. In addition, we prove that a noncompact stable MOTS in an initial data set (M,g,k) is conformally diffeomorphic to either the plane C or to the cylinder A and in the latter case infinitesimal rigidity holds. If the data have harmonic asymptotics, the former case is also proven to be globally rigid in the sense that the presence of a stable MOTS forces an isometric embedding of (M,g,k) in the Minkowski spacetime (\\mathbb{M},\\eta) as a spacelike slice. \n",

On the space of K\\\"ahler metrics that are invariant under  and represent the cohomology class , we define a flow equation whose critical points are extremal metrics, those that minimize the square of the norm of the scalar curvature. We prove that the dynamical system in this space of metrics defined by the said flow does not have periodic orbits, and that its only fixed points are extremal metrics. We prove local time existence of the flow, and conclude that if the lifespan of the solution is finite, then the supremum of the norm of its curvature tensor must blowup as time approaches it. While doing this, we also prove that extremal solitons can only exist in the noncompact case, and that the range of the holomorphy potential of the scalar curvature is an interval independent of the metric chosen to represent . We end up with some conjectures concerning the plausible existence and convergence of global solutions under suitable geometric conditions. \n",

In such cases, there is a filtration of the singular set, , where x; equivalently no tangent cone splits off a Euclidean factor  isometrically. Moreover, by , . However, little else has been understood about the structure of the singular set .   Our first result for such limit spaces  states that  is rectifiable. In fact, we will show that for a.e. , {\\it every} tangent cone  at  is symmetric i.e. that  where  might depend on the particular . We use this to show that there exists , and a rectifible set , with finite dimensional Hausdorff measure , such that  is biH\\\"older equivalent to a smooth riemannian manifold. This improves the regularity results of . Additionally, we will see that tangent cones are unique of a subset of Hausdorff  dimensional measure zero.   Our analysis is based on several new ideas, including a sharp conesplitting theorem and a geometric transformation theorem, which will allow us to control the degeneration of harmonic functions on these neck regions. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "   We study a family of reactiondiffusion equations that present a doubly nonlinear character given by a combination of the Laplacian and the porous medium operators. We consider the socalled slow diffusion regime, corresponding to a degenerate behaviour at the level 0, \\normalcolor in which nonnegative solutions with compactly supported initial data have a compact support for any later time. For some results we will also require  to avoid the possibility of a singular behaviour away from 0.   Problems in this family have a unique (up to translations) travelling wave with a finite front. When the initial datum is bounded, radially symmetric and compactly supported, we will prove that solutions converging to 1 (which exist, as we show, for all the reaction terms under consideration for wide classes of initial data) do so by approaching a translation of this unique traveling wave in the radial direction, but with a logarithmic correction in the position of the front when the dimension is bigger than one. As a corollary we obtain the asymptotic location of the free boundary and level sets in the nonradial case up to an error term of size . In dimension one we extend our results to cover the case of nonsymmetric initial data, as well as the case of bounded initial data with supporting sets unbounded in one direction of the real line. A main technical tool of independent interest is an estimate for the flux.   Most of our results are new even for the special cases of the porous medium equation and the Laplacian evolution equation. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "   Critical measures in the complex plane are saddle points for the logarithmic energy with external field. Their local and global structure was described by MartinezFinkelshtein and Rakhmanov. In this paper we start the development of a theory of critical measures on higher genus Riemann surfaces, where the logarithmic energy is replaced by the energy with respect to a bipolar Green's kernel. We study a maxmin problem for the bipolar Green's energy with external fields Re V where dV is a meromorphic differential. Under reasonable assumptions the maxmin problem has a solution and we show that the corresponding equilibrium measure is a critical measure in the external field. In a special genus one situation we are able to show that the critical measure is supported on maximal trajectories of a meromorphic quadratic differential.   We are motivated by applications to random lozenge tilings of a hexagon with periodic weightings. Correlations in these models are expressible in terms of matrix valued orthogonal polynomials. The matrix orthogonality is interpreted as (partial) scalar orthogonality on a Riemann surface. The theory of critical measures will be useful for the asymptotic analysis of a corresponding RiemannHilbert problem as we outline in the paper. \n",

      "   The paper aims at investigating two types of decay structure for linear symmetric hyperbolic systems with nonsymmetric relaxation. Precisely, the system is of the type  if the real part of all eigenvalues admits an upper bound , where  is a generic positive constant and  is the frequency variable, and the system enjoys the regularityloss property if . It is well known that the standard type  can be assured by the classical KawashimaShizuta condition. A new structural condition was introduced in  to analyze the regularityloss type  system with nonsymmetric relaxation. In the paper, we construct two more complex models of the regularityloss type corresponding to ,  and , , respectively, where  denotes phase dimensions. The proof is based on the delicate Fourier energy method as well as the suitable linear combination of series of energy inequalities. Due to arbitrary higher dimensions, it is not obvious to capture the energy dissipation rate with respect to the degenerate components. Thus, for each model, the analysis always starts from the case of low phase dimensions in order to understand the basic dissipative structure in the general case, and in the mean time, we also give the explicit construction of the compensating symmetric matrix  and skewsymmetric matrix . \n",

In this perspective, it is important to control the deformations effects introduced on the spectrum and on the time propagator by this class of nonselfadjont perturbations. In order to obtain uniformintime estimates of the perturbed semigroup, our strategy consists in constructing stationary waves operators allowing to intertwine the modified nonselfadjoint Schr\\\"odinger operator with a 'physical' Hamiltonian. For small values of a deformation parameter '{\\theta}', this yields a dynamical comparison between the two models showing that the distance between the corresponding semigroups is dominated by |{\\theta}| uniformly in time in the L^2operator norm. \n",

The main issue to overcome is the rigidity of the complex objects, since the transfer operator is a nonholomorphic perturbation of the operator . The system is moreover nonuniformly hyperbolic and one may have critical points on the Julia set. The construction of our norm requires the introduction and study of several intermediate new norms, and a careful combination of ideas from pluripotential and interpolation theory. As far as we know, this is the first time that pluripotential methods have been applied to solve a mixed realcomplex problem. Thanks to the spectral gap, we establish an exponential speed of convergence for the equidistribution of the backward orbits of points towards the conformal measure. Moreover, we obtain a full list of statistical properties for the equilibrium states: exponential mixing, CLT, BerryEsseen theorem, local CLT, ASIP, LIL, LDP, almost sure CLT. Many of these properties are new even in dimension one, some even in the case of zero weight function (i.e., for the measure of maximal entropy). \n",

Subsequently, we characterize the space of solutions of the associated initial and boundary value problem under the assumption that advanced and retarded Green operators do exist. This hypothesis is proven to be verified by a large class of boundary conditions using the method of boundary triples and under the additional assumption that the underlying spacetime is ultrastatic. Subsequently we focus on the Maxwell operator. First we construct the boundary conditions which entail a Green's formula for such operator and then we highlight two distinguished cases, dubbed tangential and normal boundary conditions. Associated to these we introduce two different notions of gauge equivalence and we prove that in both cases, every equivalence class admits a representative abiding to the Lorenz gauge. We use this property and the analysis of the operator  to construct and to classify the space of gauge equivalence classes of solutions of the Maxwell's equations with the prescribed boundary conditions. As a last step and in the spirit of future applications in the framework of algebraic quantum field theory, we construct the associated unital algebras of observables proving in particular that, as in the case of the Maxwell operator on globally hyperbolic spacetimes with empty boundary, they possess a nontrivial center. \n",

We show general wellposedness and regularity results, extending the corresponding results that are known for the nonfractional elliptic operators with zero Neumann conditions or other boundary conditions like Dirichlet or Robin ones.

In the final part of the paper we study the asymptotic behavior of the system as the parameter  appearing in the operator  that plays in the phase equation decreasingly tends to zero.

We quantize these two systems within the algebraic approach to quantum field theory using the socalled functional formalism. As a first step we construct a suitable unital *algebra of observables whose generating functionals are characterized by a labelling space which is at the same time optimal and separating and fulfils the Flocality property. Subsequently we give a definition for these systems of Hadamard states and we investigate explicit examples. In the case of a single plate, it turns out that one can build algebraic states via a pullback of those on the whole Minkowski spacetime, moreover inheriting from them the Hadamard property. When we consider instead two plates, algebraic states can be put in correspondence with those on flat spacetime via the socalled method of images, which we translate to the algebraic setting. For a massless scalar field we show that this procedure works perfectly for a large class of quasifree states including the Poincar\\'e vacuum and KMS states. Eventually Wick polynomials are introduced. Contrary to the Minkowski case, the extended algebras, built in globally hyperbolic subregions can be collected in a global counterpart only after a suitable deformation which is expressed locally in terms of a *isomorphism. As a last step, we construct explicitly the twopoint function and the regularized energy density, showing, moreover, that the outcome is consistent with the standard results of the Casimir effect. \n",

      "   We establish the existence of a spectral gap for the transfer operator induced on  by a generic holomorphic endomorphism and a suitable continuous weight and its perturbations on various functional spaces, which is new even in dimension one. The main issue to overcome is the rigidity of the complex objects, since the transfer operator is a nonholomorphic perturbation of the operator . The system is moreover nonuniformly hyperbolic and one may have critical points on the Julia set. The construction of our norm requires the introduction and study of several intermediate new norms, and a careful combination of ideas from pluripotential and interpolation theory. As far as we know, this is the first time that pluripotential methods have been applied to solve a mixed realcomplex problem. Thanks to the spectral gap, we establish an exponential speed of convergence for the equidistribution of the backward orbits of points towards the conformal measure. Moreover, we obtain a full list of statistical properties for the equilibrium states: exponential mixing, CLT, BerryEsseen theorem, local CLT, ASIP, LIL, LDP, almost sure CLT. Many of these properties are new even in dimension one, some even in the case of zero weight function (i.e., for the measure of maximal entropy). \n",

      "\n",
      "   The paper aims at investigating two types of decay structure for linear symmetric hyperbolic systems with nonsymmetric relaxation. Precisely, the system is of the type  if the real part of all eigenvalues admits an upper bound , where  is a generic positive constant and  is the frequency variable, and the system enjoys the regularityloss property if . It is well known that the standard type  can be assured by the classical KawashimaShizuta condition. A new structural condition was introduced in  to analyze the regularityloss type  system with nonsymmetric relaxation. In the paper, we construct two more complex models of the regularityloss type corresponding to ,  and , , respectively, where  denotes phase dimensions. The proof is based on the delicate Fourier energy method as well as the suitable linear combination of series of energy inequalities. Due to arbitrary higher dimensions, it is not obvious to capture the energy dissipation rate with respect to the degenerate components. Thus, for each model, the analysis always starts from the case of low phase dimensions in order to understand the basic dissipative structure in the general case, and in the mean time, we also give the explicit construction of the compensating symmetric matrix  and skewsymmetric matrix . \n",

      "   We investigate here the interactions of waves governed by a Boussinesq system with a partially immersed body allowed to move freely in the vertical direction. We show that the whole system of equations can be reduced to a transmission problem for the Boussinesq equations with transmission conditions given in terms of the vertical displacement of the object and of the average horizontal discharge beneath it; these two quantities are in turn determined by two nonlinear ODEs with forcing terms coming from the exterior wavefield. Understanding the dispersive contribution to the added mass phenomenon allows us to solve these equations, and a new dispersive hidden regularity effect is used to derive uniform estimates with respect to the dispersive parameter. We then derive an abstract general Cummins equation describing the motion of the solid in the return to equilibrium problem and show that it takes an explicit simple form in two cases, namely, the nonlinear non dispersive and the linear dispersive cases; we show in particular that the decay rate towards equilibrium is much smaller in the presence of dispersion. The latter situation also involves an initial boundary value problem for a nonlocal scalar equation that has an interest of its own and for which we consequently provide a general analysis. \n",

We derive a closed form formula for the long time asymptotics of the arbitrary point correlator using the ground state eigenvalue perturbation approach proposed in . In turn, appealing to the conclusion of the Hausdorff moment problem , we discover a diffusion equation with a random drift and deterministic enhanced diffusion possessing the exact same probability distribution function at long times. Such equations enjoy many ergodic properties which immediately translate to ergodicity results for the original problem. In particular, we establish that the first two Aris moments using a single realization of the random field can be used to explicitly construct all ensemble averaged moments. Also, the first two ensemble averaged moments explicitly predict any long time centered Aris moment. Our formulae quantitatively depict the dependence of the deterministic effective diffusion on the interaction between spatial structure of flow and random temporal fluctuation. This noteably contrasts the white noise case from the OU case. Further, this approximation provides many identities regarding the stationary OU process dependent time integral. We derive explicit formulae for the decaying passive scalar's long time limiting probability distribution function (PDF) for different types of initial conditions (e.g. deterministic and random). All results are verified by MonteCarlo simulations. \n",

      "   We consider the Laplacian associated with a general metric in the canonical conformal structure of the noncommutative two torus, and calculate a local expression for the term a_4 that appears in its corresponding smalltime heat kernel expansion. The final formula involves one variable functions and lengthy two, three and four variable functions of the modular automorphism of the state that encodes the conformal perturbation of the flat metric. We confirm the validity of the calculated expressions by showing that they satisfy a family of conceptually predicted functional relations. By studying these functional relations abstractly, we derive a partial differential system which involves a natural action of cyclic groups of order two, three and four and a flow in parameter space. We discover symmetries of the calculated expressions with respect to the action of the cyclic groups. In passing, we show that the main ingredients of our calculations, which come from a rearrangement lemma and relations between the derivatives up to order four of the conformal factor and those of its logarithm, can be derived by finite differences from the generating function of the Bernoulli numbers and its multiplicative inverse. We then shed light on the significance of exponential polynomials and their smooth fractions in understanding the general structure of the noncommutative geometric invariants appearing in the heat kernel expansion. As an application of our results we obtain the a_4 term for noncommutative four tori which split as products of two tori. These four tori are not conformally flat and the a_4 term gives a first hint of the Riemann curvature and the higher dimensional modular structure. \n",

First, we establish the existence of solutions for a short time, assuming the initial data is in a fourthorder Sobolev space and has Gaussian decay in the velocity variable (no decay assumptions are made in the spatial variable). Next, we show that the evolution instantaneously spreads mass to every point in its domain. The resulting pointwise lower bounds have a subGaussian rate of decay, which we show is optimal. The proof of massspreading is based on a stochastic process associated to the equation, and makes essential use of nonlocality. By combining this theorem with prior regularity results, we derive two important applications:  smoothing in all three variables, even for initial data with vacuum regions, and a continuation criterion that states the solution can be extended for as long as the mass and energy densities stay bounded from above. This is the weakest condition known to prevent blowup. In particular, it does not require a lower bound on the mass density or an upper bound on the entropy density. \n",

Subsequently, we characterize the space of solutions of the associated initial and boundary value problem under the assumption that advanced and retarded Green operators do exist. This hypothesis is proven to be verified by a large class of boundary conditions using the method of boundary triples and under the additional assumption that the underlying spacetime is ultrastatic. Subsequently we focus on the Maxwell operator. First we construct the boundary conditions which entail a Green's formula for such operator and then we highlight two distinguished cases, dubbed tangential and normal boundary conditions. Associated to these we introduce two different notions of gauge equivalence and we prove that in both cases, every equivalence class admits a representative abiding to the Lorenz gauge. We use this property and the analysis of the operator  to construct and to classify the space of gauge equivalence classes of solutions of the Maxwell's equations with the prescribed boundary conditions.

We quantize these two systems within the algebraic approach to quantum field theory using the socalled functional formalism. As a first step we construct a suitable unital *algebra of observables whose generating functionals are characterized by a labelling space which is at the same time optimal and separating and fulfils the Flocality property. Subsequently we give a definition for these systems of Hadamard states and we investigate explicit examples. In the case of a single plate, it turns out that one can build algebraic states via a pullback of those on the whole Minkowski spacetime, moreover inheriting from them the Hadamard property. When we consider instead two plates, algebraic states can be put in correspondence with those on flat spacetime via the socalled method of images, which we translate to the algebraic setting. For a massless scalar field we show that this procedure works perfectly for a large class of quasifree states including the Poincar\\'e vacuum and KMS states. Eventually Wick polynomials are introduced. Contrary to the Minkowski case, the extended algebras, built in globally hyperbolic subregions can be collected in a global counterpart only after a suitable deformation which is expressed locally in terms of a *isomorphism.

      "   A nonHermitian operator may serve as the Hamiltonian for a unitary quantum system, if we can modify the Hilbert space of state vectors of the system so that it turns into a Hermitian operator. If this operator is timedependent, the modified Hilbert space is generally timedependent. This in turn leads to a generic conflict between the condition that the Hamiltonian is an observable of the system and that it generates a unitary timeevolution via the standard Schr\\\"odinger equation. We propose a geometric framework for addressing this problem. In particular we show that the Hamiltonian operator consists of a geometric part, which is determined by a metriccompatible connection on an underlying Hermitian vector bundle, and a nongeometric part which we identify with the energy observable. The same quantum system can be locally described using a timedependent Hamiltonian that acts in a timeindependent state space and is the sum of a geometric part and the energy operator. The full global description of the system is achieved within the framework of a moderate geometric extension of quantum mechanics where the role of the Hilbert space of state vectors is played by a Hermitian vector bundle  endowed with a metric compatible connection, and observables are given by global sections of a real vector bundle that is determined by .

In this article we define the class of pair block diagonal generators, which allows for additional interaction coefficients but preserves the main structural properties. Namely, when the basis of the underlying Hilbert space is given by the eigenbasis of the Hamiltonian (for example the generic semigroups), then the action of the semigroup leaves invariant the diagonal and offdiagonal matrix spaces. In this case, we explicitly compute all invariant states of the semigroup.   In order to define this class we provide a characterization of when the GoriniKossakowskiSudarshanLindblad (GKSL) equation defines a proper generator when arbitrary Lindblad operators are allowed (in particular, they do not need to be traceless as demanded by the GKSL Theorem). Moreover, we consider the converse construction to show that every generator naturally gives rise to a digraph, and that under certain assumptions the properties of this digraph can be exploited to gain knowledge of both the number and the structure of the invariant states of the corresponding semigroup. \n",

      "   We derive the formula of the entanglement entropy between the left and right oscillating modes of the model with the de Sitter target space. To this end, we study the theory in the \\emph{cosmological gauge} in which the nonvanishing components of the metric on the twodimensional base space are functions of the expansion parameter of the de Sitter space. The model is embedded in the causal north pole diamond of the Penrose diagram. We argue that the cosmological gauge is natural to the model as it is compatible with the canonical quantization relations. In this gauge, we obtain a new general solution to the equations of motion in terms of timeindependent oscillating modes. The constraint structure is adequate for quantization in the GuptaBleuler formalism. We construct the space of states as a oneparameter family of Hilbert spaces and give the BargmannFock and JordanSchwinger representations of it. Also, we give a simple description of the physical subspace as an infinite product of  in the positive discreet series irreducible representations of the  group. We construct the map generated by the Hamiltonian between states at two different values of time and show how it produces the entanglement of left and right excitations. Next, we derive the formula of the entanglement entropy of the reduced density matrix for the ground state acted upon by the Hamiltonian map. Finally, we determine the asymptotic form of the entanglement entropy of a single mode bioscillator in the limit of large values of time. \n",

      "   This paper is concerned with a nonconserved phase field system of Caginalp type in which the main operators are fractional versions of two fixed linear operators  and . The operators  and  are supposed to be densely defined, unbounded, selfadjoint, monotone in the Hilbert space , for some bounded and smooth domain , and have compact resolvents. Our definition of the fractional powers of operators uses the approach via spectral theory. A nonlinearity of doublewell type occurs in the phase equation and either a regular or logarithmic potential, as well as a nondifferentiable potential involving an indicator function, is admitted in our approach. We show general wellposedness and regularity results, extending the corresponding results that are known for the nonfractional elliptic operators with zero Neumann conditions or other boundary conditions like Dirichlet or Robin ones. Then, we investigate the longtime behavior of the system, by fully characterizing every element of the limit as a stationary solution. In the final part of the paper we study the asymptotic behavior of the system as the parameter  appearing in the operator  that plays in the phase equation decreasingly tends to zero. We can prove convergence to a phase relaxation problem at the limit, in which an additional term containing the projection of the phase variable on the kernel of  appears. \n",

      "\n",
      "   To every irreducible finite crystallographic reflection group (i.e., an irreducible finite reflection group G acting faithfully on an abelian variety X), we attach a family of classical and quantum integrable systems on X (with meromorphic coefficients). These families are parametrized by Ginvariant functions of pairs (T,s), where T is a hypertorus in X (of codimension 1), and s in G is a reflection acting trivially on T. If G is a real reflection group, these families reduce to the known generalizations of elliptic CalogeroMoser systems, but in the nonreal case they appear to be new. We give two constructions of the integrals of these systems  an explicit construction as limits of classical CalogeroMoser Hamiltonians of elliptic Dunkl operators as the dynamical parameter goes to 0 (implementing an idea of arXiv:hepth/9403178), and a geometric construction as global sections of sheaves of elliptic Cherednik algebras for the critical value of the twisting parameter. We also prove algebraic integrability of these systems for values of parameters satisfying certain integrality conditions. \n",

      "\n",
      "   We study first the supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY QM), specially the cases of the harmonic and radial oscillators. Then, we obtain a new Wronskian formula for the confluent SUSY transformation and apply the SUSY QM to the inverted oscillator.   After that, we present the polynomial Heisenberg algebras (PHA). We study the general systems described by PHA: for zeroth and firstorder we obtain the harmonic and radial oscillators, respectively; for second and thirdorder PHA, the potential is determined in terms of solutions to Painlev\\'e IV and V equations ( and ), respectively.   Later on, we review the six Painlev\\'e equations and we study the cases of  and . We prove a reduction theorem for thorder PHA to be reduced to secondorder algebras. We also prove an analogous theorem for the thorder PHA to be reduced to thirdorder ones. Through these theorems we find solutions to  and  given in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions. For some special cases, those can be classified in several solution hierarchies. In this way, we find real solutions with real parameters and complex solutions with real and complex parameters for both equations.   Finally, we study the coherent states (CS) for the SUSY partners of the harmonic oscillator that are connected with , which we will call Painlev\\'e IV coherent states. Since these systems have thirdorder ladder operators , we seek first the CS as eigenstates of the annihilation operator . We also define operators analogous to the displacement operator and we get CS departing from the extremal states in each subspace in which the Hilbert space is decomposed. We conclude our treatment applying a linearization process to the ladder operators in order to define a new displacement operator to obtain CS involving the entire Hilbert space. \n",

      "\n",
      "   In the context of mathematical hydrodynamics, we consider the group theory structure which underlies the ABCflow introduced by Beltrami, Arnold and Childress. Beltrami equation is the eigenstate equation for the first order LaplaceBeltrami operator *d, which we solve by using harmonic analysis. Taking torus T^3 constructed as R^3/L, where L is a crystallographic lattice, we present a general algorithm to construct solutions of Beltrami equation which utilizes as main ingredient the orbits under the action of the point group P_L of threevectors in the momentum lattice L*. We introduce the new notion of a Universal Classifying Group GU_L which contains all crystallographic space groups as proper subgroups. We show that the *deigenfunctions are naturally arranged into irreducible representations of GU_L and by means of a systematic use of the branching rules with respect to various possible subgroups H of GU_L we search and find Beltrami fields with non trivial hidden symmetries. In the case of the cubic lattice the point group P_L is the proper octahedral group O_24 and the Universal Classifying Group is finite group G_1536 of order 1536 which we study in full detail deriving all of its 37 irreducible representations and the associated character table. We show that the O_24 orbits in the cubic lattice are arranged into 48 equivalence classes, the parameters of the corresponding Beltrami vector fields filling all the 37 irreducible representations of G_1536. In this way we obtain an exhaustive classification of all generalized ABCflows and of their hidden symmetries. We make several conceptual comments about the possible relation of ArnoldBeltrami flows with (supersymmetric) ChernSimons gauge theories. We also suggest linear generalizations of Beltrami equation to higher odddimensions that possibly make contact with Mtheory and the geometry of fluxcompactifications. \n",
