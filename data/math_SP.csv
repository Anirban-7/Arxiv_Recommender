$u$-capacity related to the Dirichlet-Laplacian in dimension three and higher,
extending previous results of the authors, and of the authors together with

quasi-particles that, for topological reasons, only exist in a 1D or 2D world.
We consider the dimensional reduction for a 2D system of anyons in a tight
wave-guide. More specifically, we study the 2D magnetic-gauge picture model
with an imposed anisotropic harmonic potential that traps particles much
stronger in the $y$-direction than in the $x$-direction. We prove that both the
eigenenergies and the eigenfunctions are asymptotically decoupled into the
loose confining direction and the tight confining direction during this
reduction. The limit 1D system for the $x$-direction is given by the
impenetrable Tonks-Girardeau Bose gas, which has no dependency on $\alpha$, and
no trace left of the long-range interactions of the 2D model.",,,,math.AP,"['math.AP', 'cond-mat.quant-gas', 'math-ph', 'math.MP', 'math.SP', 'quant-ph']",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.06670v1

eigenvalue problem; the asymptotic stability of the first eigenvector with
possible constructive rate of convergence.This abstract theory is motivated and
illustrated by several examples of differential, intro-differential and
integral operators. In particular, we revisit the first eigenvalue problem and
the asymptotic stability of the first eigenvector for: some parabolic equations

Moutuou, Obaï B. K. Ali, Habib Benali","Multilayer networks have permeated all the sciences as a powerful
mathematical abstraction for interdependent heterogenous systems such as
multimodal brain connectomes, transportation, ecological systems, and
scientific collaboration. But describing such systems through a purely
graph-theoretic formalism presupposes that the interactions that define the
underlying infrastructures and support their functions are only pairwise-based;
a strong assumption likely leading to oversimplifications. Indeed, most
interdependent systems intrinsically involve higher-order intra- and
inter-layer interactions. For instance, ecological systems involve interactions
among groups within and in-between species, collaborations and citations link
teams of coauthors to articles and vice versa, interactions might exist among
groups of friends from different social networks, etc. While higher-order
interactions have been studied for monolayer systems through the language of
simplicial complexes and hypergraphs, a broad and systematic formalism
incorporating them into the realm of multilayer systems is still lacking. Here,
we introduce the concept of crossimplicial multicomplexes as a general
formalism for modelling interdependent systems involving higher-order intra-
and inter-layer connections. Subsequently, we introduce cross-homology and its
spectral counterpart, the cross-Laplacian operators, to establish a rigorous
mathematical framework for quantifying global and local intra- and inter-layer
topological structures in such systems. When applied to multilayer networks,
these cross-Laplacians provide powerful methods for detecting clusters in one
layer that are controlled by hubs in another layer. We call such hubs spectral
cross-hubs and define spectral persistence as a way to rank them according to
their emergence along the cross-Laplacian spectra.",,,,math.AT,"['math.AT', 'cs.SI', 'math.SP', 'physics.soc-ph']",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.05860v1

of a directed hypergraph. To do so, we study the generalisation of quivers to
directed hypergraphs. Assigning vector spaces to the nodes of a hypergraph and
multilinear maps to its hyperedges gives a hyperquiver representation.
Hyperquiver representations generalise quiver representations (where all
hyperedges are edges) and tensors (where there is only one multilinear map).
The singular vectors of a hyperquiver representation are a compatible
assignment of vectors to the nodes. We compute the dimension and degree of the
variety of singular vectors of a sufficiently generic hyperquiver
representation. Our formula specialises to known results that count the
singular vectors and eigenvectors of a generic tensor.",,,,math.AG,"['math.AG', 'math.SP', '14D21, 14C17, 15A69, 15A18, 16G20']",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.05622v1

families of operators which enter in the framework of random
quasi-one-dimensional models. We first recall what is Anderson localization
from both physical and mathematical point of views. From the Anderson-Bernoulli
conjecture in dimension 2 we justify the introduction of quasi-one-dimensional
models. Then we present different types of these models : the Schr{\""o}dinger
type in the discrete and continuous cases, the unitary type, the Dirac type and
the point-interactions type. In a second part we present tools coming from the
study of dynamical systems in dimension one : the transfer matrices formalism,
the Lyapunov exponents and the F{\""u}rstenberg group. We then prove a criterion
of localization for quasi-one-dimensional models of Schr{\""o}dinger type
involving only geometric and algebraic properties of the F{\""u}rstenberg group.
Then, in the last two sections, we review results of localization, first for
Schr{\""o}dinger type models and then for unitary type models. Each time, we
reduce the question of localization to the study of the F{\""u}rstenberg group
and show how to use more and more refined algebraic criterions to prove the
needed properties of this group. All the presented results for
quasi-one-dimensional models of Schr{\""o}dinger type include the case of
Bernoulli randomness.",,,,math-ph,"['math-ph', 'math.MP', 'math.SP']",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.05224v1

investigated in the 1980's. They act continuously in many classical Banach
sequence spaces contained in $\mathbb{C}^{\mathbb{N}_0}$, such as $\ell^p$,
$c_0$, $c$, $bv_0$, $bv$ and, as recently shown, \cite{CR4}, also in the
discrete Ces\`aro spaces $ces(p)$ and their (isomorphic) dual spaces $d_p$. In
most cases $C_t$ ($t\not=1$) is compact and its spectra and point spectrum,
together with the corresponding eigenspaces, are known. We study these
properties of $C_t$, as well as their linear dynamics and mean ergodicity, when
they act in certain non-normable sequence spaces contained in
$\mathbb{C}^{\mathbb{N}_0}$. Besides $\mathbb{C}^{\mathbb{N}_0}$ itself, the
Fr\'echet spaces considered are $\ell(p+)$, $ces(p+)$ and $d(p+)$, for $1\leq

$\Omega$ of $\mathbb R^2$ with uniform magnetic field $\beta>0$ and magnetic
Neumann boundary conditions. We find upper and lower bounds for the ground
state energy $\lambda_1$ and we provide semiclassical estimates in the spirit
of Kr\""oger for the first Riesz mean of the eigenvalues. We also discuss upper
bounds for the first eigenvalue for non-constant magnetic fields
$\beta=\beta(x)$ on a simply connected domain in a Riemannian surface. In
particular: we prove the upper bound $\lambda_1<\beta$ for a general plane
domain, and the upper bound $\lambda_1<\sup_{x\in\Omega}|\beta(x)|$ for a
variable magnetic field when $\Omega$ is simply connected. For smooth domains,
we prove a lower bound of $\lambda_1$ depending only on the intensity of the
magnetic field $\beta$ and the rolling radius of the domain. The estimates on
the Riesz mean imply an upper bound for the averages of the first $k$
eigenvalues which is sharp when $k\to\infty$ and consists of the semiclassical
limit $\dfrac{2\pi k}{|\Omega|}$ plus an oscillating term. We also construct
several examples, showing the importance of the topology: in particular we show
that an arbitrarily small tubular neighborhood of a generic simple closed curve

often to discretize it. We show that one must be extremely careful when

problems that avoids discretization issues, which we prove is stable and

obtain a constructive procedure for solving this inverse problem assuming that
the common boundary conditions are of the Robin type and they are pairwise

quasi-ergodicity on $L^p(M,\mu)$ and uniqueness of the quasi-stationary measure
with the finiteness of the heat content of the semigroup (for large values of

progressively propagates in space as $t \uparrow \infty$; the propagation rate
is determined by the decay of $U_t \mathbb{1}_M(x)$. We discuss several

many-body Schr\""odinger operators at two-cluster thresholds. While the two-body
problem (reduced after separation of the center of mass motion to a one-body
problem at zero energy) is a well-studied subject, the literature on the
many-body problem is sparse. However our analysis covers for example the system
of three particles interacting by Coulomb potentials and restricted to a small
energy region to the right of a fixed nonzero two-body eigenvalue $\lambda_0$.
In general we address the question: How does scattering quantities for the
many-body atomic and molecular models behave in the limit when the total energy
approaches a fixed two-cluster threshold $\lambda_0$? This includes mapping
properties and singularities of the limiting scattering matrix, asymptotics of
the total scattering cross-section and absence of transmission from one channel
to another in the small inter-cluster kinetic energy region. Our principal
tools are the Feshbach-Grushin dimension reduction method and spectral analysis
based on a certain Mourre estimate. Additional topics (of independent interest)
are the limiting absorption principle, micro-local resolvent estimates, Rellich
and Sommerfeld type theorems and asymptotics of the limiting resolvents at
thresholds. While all of these features are fairly well-understood for two-body
Schr\""odinger operators, they are poorly understood in the many-body case even

where $H^0$ is an unperturbed autonomous Hamiltonian, $a\geq 1$, and
$W(T,\cdot)$ has a period of $T_{\rm per} >0$. In particular, in the small

the monodromy operator, the one-period flow map associated with the

an exact invariance property for band-limited Floquet-Bloch wavepackets, which

bounded commuting operators. Their definitions are based on the Cauchy formula
of slice hyperholomorphic functions and on the factorization of the Laplace
operator in terms of the Cauchy-Fueter operator
  $\mathcal{D}$ and of its conjugate $\overline{\mathcal{D}}$. Thanks to the
Fueter extension theorem when we apply the operator $\mathcal{D}$ to slice
hyperholomorphic functions we obtain harmonic functions and via the Cauchy
formula of slice hyperholomorphic functions we establish an integral
representation for harmonic functions. This integral formula is used to define
the harmonic functional calculus on the $S$-spectrum. Another possibility is to
apply the conjugate of the Cauchy-Fueter operator to slice hyperholomorphic
functions. In this case, with a similar procedure we obtain the class of
polyanalytic functions, their integral representation and the associated
polyanalytic functional calculus. The aim of this paper is to extend the
harmonic and the polyanalytic functional calculi to the case of unbounded
operators and to prove some of the most important properties. These two
functional calculi belong to so called fine structures on the $S$-spectrum in

assumption that the potential vanishes on the corresponding subinterval. In the
present paper, we waive that assumption in favor of a continuously matching
initial function, which leads to appearing an additional term with frozen
argument in the equation. For the resulting new inverse problem, we pay a
special attention to the situation when one of the spectra is given only
partially. Sufficient conditions and necessary conditions on the corresponding
subspectrum for the unique determination of the potential are obtained, and a
constructive procedure for solving the inverse problem is given. In parallel,

torus. Among particular settings where such a question arises are the
Floquet--Bloch decomposition of periodic Schroedinger operators, topology of
potential energy surfaces in quantum chemistry, spectral optimization problems
such as minimal spectral partitions of manifolds, as well as nodal statistics
of graph eigenfunctions. In contrast to the classical Morse theory dealing with
smooth functions, the eigenvalues of families of self-adjoint matrices are not
smooth at the points corresponding to repeated eigenvalues (called, depending
on the application and on the dimension of the parameter space, the
diabolical/Dirac/Weyl points or the conical intersections).
  This work develops a procedure for associating a Morse polynomial to a point
of eigenvalue multiplicity; it utilizes the assumptions of smoothness and
self-adjointness of the family to provide concrete answers. In particular, we
define the notions of non-degenerate topologically critical point and
generalized Morse family, establish that generalized Morse families are generic
in an appropriate sense, establish a differential first-order conditions for
criticality, as well as compute the local contribution of a topologically
critical point to the Morse polynomial. Remarkably, the non-smooth contribution
to the Morse polynomial turns out to be universal: it depends only on the size
of the eigenvalue multiplicity and the relative position of the eigenvalue of
interest and not on the particulars of the operator family; it is expressed in

constitutes the key step of many computer vision tasks. The goal is to recover
$n$ latent permutations from their noisy and incomplete pairwise measurements.
In recent years, spectral methods have gained increasing popularity thanks to
their simplicity and computational efficiency. Spectral methods utilize the
leading eigenspace $U$ of the data matrix and its block submatrices
$U_1,U_2,\ldots, U_n$ to recover the permutations. In this paper, we propose a
novel and statistically optimal spectral algorithm. Unlike the existing methods
which use $\{U_jU_1^\top\}_{j\geq 2}$, ours constructs an anchor matrix $M$ by
aggregating useful information from all the block submatrices and estimates the
latent permutations through $\{U_jM^\top\}_{j\geq 1}$. This modification
overcomes a crucial limitation of the existing methods caused by the repetitive
use of $U_1$ and leads to an improved numerical performance. To establish the
optimality of the proposed method, we carry out a fine-grained spectral
analysis and obtain a sharp exponential error bound that matches the minimax

Problem of a Graph $G$ (IEP-G) aims to find all possible spectra for matrices
whose $(i,j)-$entry, for $i\neq j$, is nonzero precisely when $i$ is adjacent
to $j$. A cluster in a graph $G$ is a pair of vertex subsets $(C, S)$, where
$C$ is a maximal set of cardinality $\vert C\vert\geq 2$ of independent
vertices sharing the same set $S$ of $\vert S\vert$ neighbors. Let $G$ be a
connected graph on $n$ vertices with a cluster $(C, S)$ and $H$ be a graph of
order $\vert C\vert$. Let $G(H)$ be the connected graph obtained from $G$ and
$H$ when the edges of $H$ are added to the edges of $G$ by identifying the
vertices of $H$ with the vertices in $C$. In this paper, we construct a
symmetric matrix with associated complete graph, which satisfies some
interesting properties. This result is applied to obtain new sufficient
conditions on the IEP-G, when $G$ is a graph of order $n$ having a clique of
order $k$ and a cluster $(C,S)$, where $\vert C\vert=n-k$ and $\vert
S\vert=r\leq k$, as well as, for the graph $G(K_{n-k})$, being $G$ as before.
In particular, when $G$ is a graph obtained from $K_{n}$ by deleting a single
edge $e_{k}\in E(K_{n})$, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition on
the IEP-G. Several illustrative example are given. The constructive nature of
our results generate algorithmic procedures that always allow one to compute a

formula is a very important tool to define functions of operators. The
Fueter-Sce-Qian extension theorem is a two steps procedure to extend
holomorphic functions to the hyperholomorphic setting. The first step gives the
class of slice hyperholomorphic functions; their Cauchy formula allows to
define the so-called $S$-functional calculus for noncommuting operators based
on the $S$-spectrum. In the second step this extension procedure generates
monogenic functions; the related monogenic functional calculus, based on the
monogenic spectrum, contains the Weyl functional calculus as a particular case.
In this paper we show that the extension operator from slice hyperholomorphic
functions to monogenic functions admits various possible factorizations that
induce different function spaces. The integral representations in such spaces
allows to define the associated functional calculi based on the $S$-spectrum.
The function spaces and the associated functional calculi define the so called
{\em fine structure of the spectral theories on the $S$-spectrum}. Among the
possible fine structures there are the harmonic and poly-harmonic functions and
the associated harmonic and poly-harmonic functional calculi. The study of the
fine structures depends on the dimension considered and in this paper we study
in detail the case of dimension five, and we describe all of them. The
five-dimensional case is of crucial importance because it allows to determine
almost all the function spaces will also appear in dimension greater than five,

operators possessing commuting shift operators. One particularly striking
implication of this is the correspondence between discrete and continuous pairs
of commuting operators. Moreover, all results are proved in the setting of
matrix valued functions, which provides further advantages for applications.

most 5 degrees of freedom, regardless of the size of the tree in this family.

than a proverbial engine. Thus North-South separation of 1994-2008 Ulysses <10
nT wind polar samplings spanning ~1.6 10^7-2.5 10^9-erg base energies reveals
Gauss-Vanicek spectral signatures of an entirely >99%-significant Sun-borne

order n=100+ and co-triggered by the PS=~11-yr Schwabe global mode northside,
its ~10-yr degeneration equatorially, and ~9-yr degeneration southside. The Sun
is a typical ~3-dB-attenuated ring-system of differentially rotating and
contrarily (out-of-phase) vibrating conveyor belts and layers with a continuous
spectrum and resolution (<81.3 nHz (S), <55.6 nHz (N)) in lowermost frequencies

by the set of continuous negative definite functions, that are in the weak
similarity (WS) orbit of the self-adjoint log-Bessel operator on the Euclidean
space. These WS relations turn out to be useful to first characterize a core
for each operator in this class, which enables us to show that they generate a
class, denoted by $\mathscr{P}$, of non-self-adjoint
$\mathcal{C}_0$-contraction positive semigroups. Up to a homeomorphism,
$\mathscr{P}$ includes, as fundamental objects in probability theory, the
family of self-similar Markov semigroups on $\mathbb{R}_+^d$. Relying on the WS
orbit, we characterize the nature of the spectrum of each element in
$\mathscr{P}$ that is used in their spectral representation which depends on
analytical properties of the Bernstein-gamma functions defined from the
associated negative definite functions, and, it is either the point, residual,
approximate or continuous spectrum. We proceed by providing a spectral
representation of each element in $\ccP$ which is expressed in terms of Fourier
multiplier operators and valid, at least, on a dense domain of a natural
weighted $L^2$-space. Surprisingly, the domain is the full Hilbert space when
the spectrum is the residual one, something which seems to be noticed for the
first time in the literature. We end up the paper by presenting a series of

Laplacian in an unbounded 3D periodic lattice made of thin bars (of width

with the union of segments which all go to $+\infty$ as $\varepsilon$ tends to
zero due to the Dirichlet boundary condition. We show that the first spectral
segment is extremely tight, of length $O(e^{-\delta/\varepsilon})$, $\delta>0$,
while the length of the next spectral segments is $O(\varepsilon)$. To
establish these results, we need to study in detail the properties of the
Dirichlet Laplacian $A^{\Omega}$ in the geometry $\Omega$ obtained by zooming
at the junction regions of the initial periodic lattice. This problem has its
own interest and playing with symmetries together with max-min arguments as
well as a well-chosen Friedrichs inequality, we prove that $A^{\Omega}$ has a
unique eigenvalue in its discrete spectrum, which generates the first spectral
segment. Additionally we show that there is no threshold resonance for
$A^{\Omega}$, that is no non trivial bounded solution at the threshold
frequency for $A^{\Omega}$. This implies that the correct 1D model of the

Dirichlet eigenfunctions on triangles enjoys an equidistribution law, being
equidistributed on each side. The proof of this result is remarkably simple,
using only the radial vector field and a Rellich type integrations by parts.
The equidistribution law, including on higher dimensional simplices, agrees
with what Quantum Ergodic Restriction would predict. However, distribution of
the Neumann data on subsets of a side is not well understood, and elementary
methods do not appear to give enough information to draw conclusions.

use a result of Marklof-Rudnick \cite{Marklof-Rudnick} in which the authors

In our work we explore to what extent a similar relation is true for block
Jacobi operators. In this setup, under some uniformity conditions, we show that
nonsubordinacy in the sense of matrix generalized eigenvectors also implies the
absolute continuity, similarly as in the case of the scalar Jacobi operator.
Namely, we get the absolute continuity of the matrix spectral measure with the
invertibility of its density almost everywhere. We also present an example
showing that the reverse implication in general does not hold. We extend some
sufficient conditions for nonsubordinacy from the scalar to the block case.

sciences. For example, it appears in many partial differential equations
(PDEs). For scalar bistable reaction-diffusions PDEs, the bistable case even
has take on different names within communities such as Allee, Allen-Cahn,
Chafee-Infante, Nagumo, Ginzburg-Landau, $\Phi_4$, Schl\""ogl, Stommel, just to
name a few structurally similar bistable model names. One key mechanism, how
bistability arises under parameter variation is a pitchfork bifurcation. In
particular, taking the pitchfork bifurcation normal form for reaction-diffusion
PDEs is yet another variant within the family of PDEs mentioned above. More
generally, the study of this PDE class considering steady states and stability,
related to bifurcations due to a parameter is well-understood for the
deterministic case. For the stochastic PDE (SPDE) case, the situation is less
well-understood and has been studied recently. In this paper we generalize and
unify several recent results for SPDE bifurcations. Our generalisation is
motivated directly by applications as we introduce in the equation a spatially
heterogeneous term and relax the assumptions on the covariance operator that
defines the noise. For this spatially heterogeneous SPDE, we prove a
finite-time Lyapunov exponent bifurcation result. Furthermore, we extend the
theory of early warning signs in our context and we explain, the role of
universal exponents between covariance operator warning signs and the lack of
finite-time Lyapunov uniformity. Our results are accompanied and

focus of the literature is on the unweighted and structurally balanced ones,
where all cycles have an even number of negative edges. Hence here, we first
introduce a classification of signed networks into balanced, antibalanced or
strictly balanced ones, and then characterize each type of signed networks in
terms of the spectral properties of the signed weighted adjacency matrix. In
particular, we show that the spectral radius of the matrix with signs is
smaller than that without if and only if the signed network is strictly
unbalanced. These properties are important to understand the dynamics on signed
networks, both linear and nonlinear ones. Specifically, we find consistent
patterns in a linear and a nonlinear dynamics theoretically, depending on their

unbalanced networks, motivated by perturbation theory. Finally, we numerically

This implies general upper and lower bounds on the landscape product
$\lambda\|u\|_\infty$ for several models, including the Anderson model and
random hopping (bond-disordered) models, on graphs that are roughly isometric
to $\mathbb{Z}^d$, as well as on some fractal-like graphs such as the
Sierpinski gasket graph. Next, we specialize to a random hopping model on

product $\lambda\|u\|_\infty$ approaches $\pi^2/8$ for Bernoulli off-diagonal
disorder, and has the same upper bound of $\pi^2/8$ for Uniform([0,1])
off-diagonal disorder. We also numerically study the random hopping model when

motivated by the quest for rigorous quantizations of gauge theories. The first
part is based on [Skripka,vN - JST 2022], [van Suijlekom,vN - JNCG 2021], and
[van Suijlekom,vN - JHEP 2022], and concerns the spectral action of
noncommutative geometry and its perturbative expansions. We prove the existence
of a higher-order spectral shift function under the relative Schatten class
assumption, give a converging series expansion of the spectral action in terms
of Chern--Simons and Yang--Mills forms, and show one-loop renormalizability of
the spectral action in a generalized sense. The second part is based on
[Stienstra,vN 2020] and [vN - LMP 2022] and concerns a non-perturbative
approach to quantum gauge theory by means of Hamiltonian lattice gauge theory
and strict quantization. We construct C*-algebras of U(1)^n-gauge observables
on the lattice, show that they are conserved under the relevant time
evolutions, construct continuum limit C*-algebras, and show that the result

domains $\Omega$ := $\Omega$ ' x (0, H) $\subseteq$ R^d x R ^+. The diffusion
coefficient c > 0 depends on one coordinate y $\in$ (0, H) and is bounded but
may be discontinuous. This corresponds to the physical model of ''layered
media'', appearing in acoustics, elasticity, optical fibers... Dirichlet
boundary conditions are assumed. In general, for each $\epsilon$ > 0, the set
of eigenfunctions is divided into a disjoint union of three subsets : Fng
(non-guided), Fg (guided) and Fres (residual). The residual set shrinks as
$\epsilon$ $\rightarrow$ 0. The customary physical terminology of
guided/non-guided is often replaced in the mathematical literature by
concentrating/non-concentrating solutions, respectively. For guided waves, the
assumption of ''layered media'' enables us to obtain rigorous estimates of
their exponential decay away from concentration zones. The case of non-guided
waves has attracted less attention in the literature. While it is not so
closely connected to physical models, it leads to some very interesting
questions concerning oscillatory solutions and their asymptotic properties.
Classical asymptotic methods are available for c(y) $\in$ C 2 but a lesser
degree of regularity excludes such methods. The associated eigenfunctions (in
Fng) are oscillatory. However, this fact by itself does not exclude the
possibility of ''flattening out'' of the solution between two consecutive
zeros, leading to concentration in the complementary segment. Here we show it
cannot happen when c(y) is of bounded variation, by proving a ''minimal
amplitude hypothesis''. However the validity of such results when c(y) is not

recent developments in quantum information theory, Williamson's normal form has
opened up an active research area that may be dubbed as ``finite dimensional
symplectic spectral theory"" analogous to the usual spectral theory and matrix
analysis. An infinite dimensional analogue of the Williamson's Normal form has
appeared recently and has already become a corner stone for the theory of
infinite mode quantum Gaussian states. In this article, we obtain some results
in the direction of ``infinite dimensional symplectic spectral theory"". We
prove an interlacing relation between the eigenvalues and symplectic
eigenvalues of a special class of infinite-dimensional operators with countable

The main contribution of this paper is circumventing tedious probabilistic
methods with a study of a composition of the Markov transition operator $P$
followed by a multiplication operator defined by $e^{r}$. It turns out that
even if the observable/ reward function is unbounded, but for some for some
$q>2$, $\|e^{r}\|_{q \rightarrow 2} \propto \exp\big(\mu_{\pi}(r)

non-asymptotic concentration bounds follow. \emph{Transport-entropy} inequality
ensures the aforementioned upper bound on multiplication operator for all

simplicial complex $K$. We study its spectral limiting behavior under a given
non-trivial subdivision procedure $\text{div}$. It will be shown that in case
$\text{div}$ satisfies a property we call inclusion-uniformity its spectrum
converges to a universal limiting distribution only depending on the dimension
of $K$. This class of subdivisions contains important special cases such as the
edgewise subdivision $\text{esd}_r$ for $r\geq 2$ and dimension $d=2$ or the
barycentric subdivision $\text{sd}$. This parallels a result of Brenti and
Welker showing that the roots of $f$-polynomials of iterated barycentric
subdivisions converge to a universal set of roots only depending on the
dimension of $K$.
  Furthermore we determine the family of universal limiting functions for the
particular subdivision where the top dimensional faces are replaced by a cone
over their boundary. We will show that this choice of $\text{div}$ is the
natural generalization of graph subdivision in the spectral sense. These limits
are obtained by explicit spectral decimation of the sequence of its dual graphs
which is represented as a sequence of Schreier graphs on a rooted regular tree.
  Finally we will point out that a generic sequence of iterated subdivisions

differs from it in general. We prove that spectral concentration occurs on the
shief generated by Lie brackets of length r-1, where r is the degree of
nonholonomy. In the singular case, like Martinet or Grushin, the situation is

  In this paper, the concept of extended vertex energy is introduced and some

upper bounds of the extended energy of a graph. Next, we obtain two
inequalities which relate the extended energy with the ordinary graph energy.
One of those inequalities resolves a conjecture which states that for every
graph, ordinary energy can never exceed the extended energy. Using the
relationships of extended energy and ordinary energy, we obtain new bounds of
extended energy involving the order, size, largest and smallest degree of the

the rigidity in the case of $2$-tori, we show that there exists a $2$-parameter
family of non-congruent $\lambda_1$-minimal flat $4$-tori. It turns out that
the examples we constructed exhaust all $\lambda_1$-minimal immersions of
conformally flat $3$-tori and $4$-tori in spheres. The classification involves
some detailed investigations of shortest vectors in lattices, which can also be
used to solve the Berger's problem on flat $3$-tori and $4$-tori. The
dilation-invariant functional $\lambda_1(g)V(g)^{\frac{2}{n}}$ about the first

Malcolm Brown, Marco Marletta, Sergey Naboko, Ian Wood","The spectral and scattering properties of non-selfadjoint problems pose a
mathematical challenge. Apart from exceptional cases, the well-developed
methods used to examine the spectrum of selfadjoint problems are not
applicable. One of the tools to attack non-selfadjoint problems are functional
models. A drawback of many functional models is that their constructions
require objects which may be difficult to describe explicitly, such as operator
square roots, making it hard to apply the results to specific examples.
  We develop a functional model for the case when the non-selfadjointness
arises both in additive terms and in the boundary conditions which is based on
the Lagrange identity. The flexibility of the choice of the $\Gamma$-operators
in the Lagrange identity means that these can be chosen so that expressions
arising in the model are given explicitly in terms of physical parameters
(coefficients, boundary conditions and Titchmarsh-Weyl $M$-function) of the
maximally dissipative operator. The presentation of such explicit expressions
for the spectral form of the functional model is arguably the main contribution
of the present paper. In the spectral form of the functional model, the
selfadjoint dilation is very simple, being the operator of multiplication by an
independent variable in some auxiliary vector-valued function space. We also
obtain an explicit expression for the completely non-selfadjoint part of the
operator and an operator-analytic proof of the famous result by Sz.-Nagy-Foias
on the pure absolute continuity of the spectrum of the minimal selfadjoint
dilation. Finally, we consider an example of a limit circle Sturm-Liouville
operator.","To appear in a special volume of the St. Petersburg Mathematics

holomorphic function is extended to a slice hyperholomorphic function. The
Cauchy formula for these type of functions is the starting point of the
$S$-functional calculus. In the second step a monogenic function is obtained by
applying the Laplace operator in four real variables, namely $ \Delta$, to a
slice hyperholomorphic function. The polyanalytic functional calculus, that we
study in this paper, is based on the factorization of $\Delta= \mathcal{D}

slice hyperholomorphic function we apply first the operator $
\mathcal{\overline{D}}$ and we get a polyanalytic function of order 2, i..e, a

$3$-manifolds. We pay particular attention to the dissipative case, that is,
Anosov flows that do not preserve an absolutely continuous measure. Such flows
have two distinguished Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen $3$-forms,
$\Omega_{\text{SRB}}^{\pm}$, and the cohomology classes
$[\iota_{X}\Omega_{\text{SRB}}^{\pm}]$ (where $X$ is the infinitesimal
generator of the flow) play a key role in the determination of the space of
resonant $1$-forms. When both classes vanish we associate to the flow a
$\textit{helicity}$ that naturally extends the classical notion associated with
null-homologous volume preserving flows. We provide a general theory that
includes horocyclic invariance of resonant $1$-forms and SRB-measures as well
as the local geometry of the maps $X\mapsto
[\iota_{X}\Omega_{\text{SRB}}^{\pm}]$ near a null-homologous volume preserving
flow. Next, we study several relevant classes of examples. Among these are
thermostats associated with holomorphic quadratic differentials, giving rise to
quasi-Fuchsian flows as introduced by Ghys. For these flows we compute
explicitly all resonant $1$-forms at zero, we show that
$[\iota_{X}\Omega_{\text{SRB}}^{\pm}]=0$ and give an explicit formula for the
helicity. In addition we show that a generic time change of a quasi-Fuchsian
flow is semisimple and thus the order of vanishing of the Ruelle zeta function
at zero is $-\chi(M)$, the same as in the geodesic flow case. In contrast, we
show that if $(M,g)$ is a closed surface of negative curvature, the Gaussian

anomalous magnetic interactions of strengths $\eta, \tau, \lambda \in
\mathbb{R}$, respectively, supported on points in $\mathbb{R}$, curves in
$\mathbb{R}^2$, and surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$ that is based on boundary
triples and their associated Weyl functions. First, we discuss the
one-dimensional case which also serves as a motivation for the multidimensional
setting. Afterwards, in the two and three-dimensional situation we construct
quasi, generalized, and ordinary boundary triples and their Weyl functions, and
provide a detailed characterization of the associated Sobolev spaces, trace
theorems, and the mapping properties of integral operators which play an
important role in the analysis of $A_{\eta, \tau, \lambda}$. We make a
substantial step towards more rough interaction supports $\Sigma$ and consider
general compact Lipschitz hypersurfaces. We derive conditions for the
interaction strengths such that the operators $A_{\eta, \tau, \lambda}$ are
self-adjoint, obtain a Krein-type resolvent formula, and characterize the
essential and discrete spectrum. These conditions include purely Lorentz scalar
and purely non-critical anomalous magnetic interactions as well as the
confinement case, the latter having an important application in the
mathematical description of graphene. Using a certain ordinary boundary triple,
we show the self-adjointness of $A_{\eta, \tau, \lambda}$ for arbitrary
combinations of the interaction strengths (including critical ones) under the
condition that $\Sigma$ is $C^{\infty}$-smooth and derive its spectral

represent the evolution of the eigenvalues as the domain is shrunk or expanded,
yields formulas for their concavity at the non-regular crossing in terms of the
corresponding Jordan chains. This, along with homotopy techniques, enables the
computation of the Maslov index at such a crossing. We apply our theory to
study the spectral (in)stability of standing waves in the nonlinear
Schr\""odinger equation on a compact spatial interval. We derive new stability
results in the spirit of the Jones--Grillakis instability theorem and the
Vakhitov--Kolokolov criterion, both originally formulated on the real line. A
fundamental difference upon passing from the real line to the compact interval
is the loss of translational invariance, in which case the zero eigenvalue of
the linearised operator is geometrically simple. Consequently, the stability
results differ depending on the boundary conditions satisfied by the wave. We
compare our lower bound to existing results involving constrained eigenvalue
counts, finding a direct relationship between the correction factors found
therein and the objects of our analysis, including the second-order Maslov

induces a flat metric on $L$, and a pseudo-Laplacian $\Delta_{L,0}$ acting on
functions can be associated to the Chern connection. One needs to specify
boundary conditions, and they are here chosen to be the Alvarez--Wentworth
boundary conditions, which are a combination of Dirichlet and Neumann boundary
conditions. The aim of this paper is to find the asymptotic behavior of the

associated with ergodic discrete Schr\""odinger operators in one dimension, with
scalar and matrix-valued potentials. While for an individual value of the
spectral parameter the rate of exponential growth is almost surely governed by
the Lyapunov exponents, this is not, in general, true simultaneously for all
the values of the parameter. The structure of the exceptional sets is
interesting in its own right, and is also of importance in the spectral
analysis of the operators. We present new results along with amplifications and
generalisations of several older ones, and also list a few open questions.
  Here are two sample results. On the negative side, for any square-summable
sequence $p_n$ there is a residual set of energies in the spectrum on which the
middle singular value (the $W$-th out of $2W$) grows no faster than $p_n^{-1}$.
On the positive side, for a large class of cocycles including the i.i.d. ones,
the set of energies at which the growth of the singular values is not as given
by the Lyapunov exponents has zero Hausdorff measure with respect to any gauge
function $\rho(t)$ such that $\rho(t)/t$ is integrable at zero.
  The employed arguments from the theory of subharmonic functions also yield a
generalisation of the Thouless formula, possibly of independent interest: for
each $k$, the average of the first $k$ Lyapunov exponents is the logarithmic
potential of a probability measure.","v2, 18 pp (minor changes)",,,math.SP,"['math.SP', 'math-ph', 'math.CA', 'math.CV', 'math.MP']",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.03864v2

delay on geometrical graphs that involves {\it global} delay parameter.
Differential operators on graphs model various processes in many areas of
science and technology. Although a vast majority of studies in this direction
concern purely differential operators on graphs (often referred to as quantum
graphs), recently there also appeared some considerations of nonlocal operators
on star-type graphs. In particular, there belong functional-differential
operators with constant delays but in a {\it locally} nonlocal version. The
latter means that each edge of the graph has its own delay parameter, which
does not affect any other edge. In this paper, we introduce {\it globally}
nonlocal operators that are expected to be more natural for modelling nonlocal
processes on graphs. We also extend this idea to arbitrary trees, which opens a
wide area of further research. Another goal of the paper is to study inverse
spectral problems for operators with global delay in one illustrative case by
addressing a wide range of questions including uniqueness, characterization of
the spectral data as well as the uniform stability.","26 pages, 4 figures",,,math.SP,"['math.SP', '34A55 34K29 34B45']",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.17266v1

Almonacid, Nilima Nigam","The propagation of internal gravity waves in stratified media, such as those
found in ocean basins and lakes, leads to the development of geometrical
patterns called ""attractors"". These structures accumulate much of the wave
energy and make the fluid flow highly singular. In more analytical terms, the
cause of this phenomenon has been attributed to the presence of a continuous
spectrum in some nonlocal zeroth-order pseudo-differential operators. In this
work, we analyze the generation of these attractors from a numerical analysis
perspective. First, we propose a high-order pseudo-spectral method to solve the
evolution problem (whose long-term behaviour is known to be not
square-integrable). Then, we use similar tools to discretize the corresponding
eigenvalue problem. Since the eigenvalues are embedded in a continuous
spectrum, we compute them using viscous approximations. Finally, we explore the
effect that the embedded eigenmodes have on the long-term evolution of the
system.","23 pages, 16 figures, MATLAB codes available at

Our main result characterizes $s(A) < 0$ in terms of so-called small-gain

is new even in case that the underlying space is an $L^p$-space or a space of
continuous functions.
  We also demonstrate that it becomes considerably easier to characterize the
property $s(A) < 0$ if the cone of the underlying Banach space has non-empty
interior or if the essential spectral bound of $A$ is negative. To treat the
latter case, we discuss a counterpart of a Krein-Rutman theorem for resolvent
positive operators. Our results can, in particular, be applied to generators
$A$ of positive $C_0$-semigroups. Thus, they can be interpreted as stability
results for this class of semigroups, and as such, they complement similar
results recently proved for the discrete-time case.

groups) have a sequence of finite dimensional unitary representations that
`strongly converge' to the regular representation of the group. The
corresponding statement for finitely generated free groups was proved by
Haagerup and Thorbj{\o}rnsen in 2005. In fact, we can take the unitary
representations to arise from representations of the group by permutation
matrices, as was proved for free groups by Bordenave and Collins.
  As for Haagerup and Thorbj{\o}rnsen, the existence of such representations
implies that for any non-abelian limit group, the Ext-invariant of the reduced
$C^{*}$-algebra is not a group (has non-invertible elements)
  An important special case of our main theorem is in application to the
fundamental groups of closed orientable surfaces of genus at least two. In this
case, our results can be used as an input to the methods previously developed
by the authors of the appendix. The output is a variation of our previous proof
of Buser's 1984 conjecture that there exist a sequence of closed hyperbolic
surfaces with genera tending to infinity and first eigenvalue of the Laplacian
tending to $\frac{1}{4}$. In this variation of the proof, the systoles of the
surfaces are bounded away from zero and the surfaces can be taken to be
arithmetic.","31 pages, polished previous version and now Proposition 1.3 is

eigenvalue problems for tridiagonal operators acting on Fourier coefficients in
a weighted Hilbert space and to appropriate connection problems for Heun's

for example a perturbation of $(-\Delta )^a$. Let $\Omega \subset R^n$ be
bounded, and let $P_D$ be the Dirichlet realization in $L_2(\Omega )$ defined
under the exterior condition $u=0$ in $R^n\setminus\Omega $. When $p(x,\xi )$
and $\Omega $ are $C^\infty $, it is known that the eigenvalues $\lambda _j$

to $\tilde P=P+P'+P''$, where $P'$ is an operator of order $<\min\{2a,
a+\frac12\}$ with certain mapping properties, and $P''$ is bounded in

sign-changing coefficients. With a focus on problems with piecewise constant,
scalar coefficients in a ($d$-dimensional) crosswalk type shape, we will
provide a limit procedure in order to understand potentially ill-posed and
non-coercive settings. Depending on the integral mean of the coefficient and
its inverse, the limits can either satisfy the usual homogenisation formula for
stratified media, be entirely degenerate or be a non-local differential
operator of 4th order. In order to mark the drastic change of nature, we
introduce the `inner spectrum' for conductivities. We show that even though $0$
is contained in the inner spectrum for all strictly positive periods, the limit
inner spectrum can be empty. Furthermore, even though the spectrum was confined
in a bounded set uniformly for all strictly positive periods and not containing
$0$, the limit inner spectrum might have $0$ as an essential spectral point and
accumulate at $\infty$ or even be the whole of $\mathbb{C}$. This is in stark
contrast to the classical situation, where it is possible to derive upper and
lower bounds in terms of the values assumed by the coefficients in the
pre-asymptotics. In passing, we also develop a theory for Sturm--Liouville type
operators with indefinite weights, reduce the question on solvability of the
associated Sturm--Liouville operator to understanding zeros of a certain
explicit polynomial and show that generic real perturbations of piecewise
constant coefficients lead to continuously invertible Sturm--Liouville

differential operator originally introduced as a generalization of the quantum
harmonic oscillator having a weaker $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{R})$-symmetry. The
spectrum of the NCHO has remarkable properties, including the presence of
number theoretical structures such as modular forms, elliptic curves and
Eichler cohomology observed in the special values of the associated spectral
zeta function. In addition, the Heun ODE picture of the eigenvalue problem of
the NCHO reveals a connection with the quantum Rabi model (QRM), a fundamental
interaction model from quantum optics. In this paper we introduce an
$\eta$-shifted NCHO ($\eta$-NCHO) that has an analogous relation with the
asymmetric quantum Rabi model (AQRM) and describe its basic properties. Even
though the shift factor does not break the parity symmetry of the NCHO, a
certain type of degeneracies appears for $\eta \in \frac12 \mathbb{Z}$, as if
mirroring the situation of the AQRM. We give furthermore a detailed description
of the confluence process, that we call iso-parallel confluence process due to
the fact that it requires a parallel transformation of two parameters
describing the spectrum of $\eta$-NCHO and representations of
$\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{R})$. We relate the eigenvalues of the two models
under the iso-parallel confluence process, including how the quasi-exact
eigenfunctions of the $\eta$-NCHO correspond to Juddian solutions of the AQRM.
From the point of view of this confluence process, a family of $\eta$-NCHO
corresponds to a single AQRM, thus we may regard the $\eta$-NCHO as a covering
of the AQRM. We expect the study of the $\eta$-NCHO and the AQRM from this
point of view to be helpful for the clarification of several questions on the
AQRM, including the hidden symmetry and the number of Juddian solutions.","40 Pages. General improvement over the previous version: new

spectral projectors to heat kernels, explicit estimates of the $L^p$-$L^q$

matching leading constant under a squared $\ell_2$ loss. This shows that the
spectral method has the same performance as more sophisticated procedures
including maximum likelihood estimation, generalized power method, and
semidefinite programming, when consistent parameter estimation is possible. To
establish our result, we first have a novel choice of the population
eigenvector, which enable us to establish the exact recovery of the spectral
method when there is no additive noise. We then develop a new perturbation
analysis toolkit for the leading eigenvector and show it can be
well-approximated by its first-order approximation with a small $\ell_2$ error.

energy among all admissible $k$-partitions is bounded from above by $\Sigma$,
and if it is strictly below $\Sigma$, then a spectral minimal $k$-partition
exists. We illustrate our results with several examples of existence and
non-existence of minimal partitions of unbounded and infinite graphs, with and
without potentials.

spectral information is a powerful tool for the analysis and decomposition of
nonlinear dynamical systems. However, Koopman operators are
infinite-dimensional, and computing their spectral information is a
considerable challenge. We introduce measure-preserving extended dynamic mode
decomposition ($\texttt{mpEDMD}$), the first truncation method whose
eigendecomposition converges to the spectral quantities of Koopman operators
for general measure-preserving dynamical systems. $\texttt{mpEDMD}$ is a
data-driven algorithm based on an orthogonal Procrustes problem that enforces
measure-preserving truncations of Koopman operators using a general dictionary
of observables. It is flexible and easy to use with any pre-existing DMD-type
method, and with different types of data. We prove convergence of
$\texttt{mpEDMD}$ for projection-valued and scalar-valued spectral measures,
spectra, and Koopman mode decompositions. For the case of delay embedding
(Krylov subspaces), our results include the first convergence rates of the
approximation of spectral measures as the size of the dictionary increases. We
demonstrate $\texttt{mpEDMD}$ on a range of challenging examples, its increased
robustness to noise compared with other DMD-type methods, and its ability to
capture the energy conservation and cascade of experimental measurements of a
turbulent boundary layer flow with Reynolds number $> 6\times 10^4$ and

quantization as proposed by Kostant-Souriau-Kirillov, and then relies on the
Ruelle-Pollicott spectrum of the prequantum transfer operator, which they show
to have a particular band structure. The appeal of this new quantization scheme
resides in its naturalness: the quantum behavior appears dynamically in the
classical correlation functions of the prequantum transfer operator. In this

implies, under mild assumptions, that $T$ has no unimodular eigenvalues except
for possibly the number $1$. This rules out periodic behaviour of any orbits of
the powers of $T$, and thus enables us to prove convergence of those powers in
many situations.
  For the proof we first perform a careful analysis of the action of lattice
homomorphisms on the support of functions; then we split $T$ into an invertible
and a weakly stable part, and apply the aforementioned analysis to the
invertible part. An appropriate adaptation of this argument allows us to prove

then use the formula to derive an explicit expression for the fundamental

first one is to derive a general trace formula that relates the spectral data
on $X$ to its topological data. Though we emphasize the results in the case
when $X$ is finite, our method also applies when $X$ has a countably infinite
number of vertices. As a second application, we obtain a closed-form expression
for the return time probability distribution of the uniform random walk on any
$(q+1)$-regular graph. The expression is obtained by relating
$K_{X}(x,x_{0};t)$ to the uniform random walk on a $(q+1)$-regular graph. We
then show that if $\{X_{h}\}$ is a sequence of $(q+1)$-regular graphs whose
number of vertices goes to infinity and which satisfies a certain natural

introduced as a model of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that has played a
foundational role in our understanding of these networks' stability and
invariance properties. Subsequently, there has been widespread interest in
extending the success of CNNs to data sets with non-Euclidean structure, such
as graphs and manifolds, leading to the emerging field of geometric deep
learning. In order to improve our understanding of the architectures used in
this new field, several papers have proposed generalizations of the scattering
transform for non-Euclidean data structures such as undirected graphs and
compact Riemannian manifolds without boundary.
  In this paper, we introduce a general, unified model for geometric scattering
on measure spaces. Our proposed framework includes previous work on geometric
scattering as special cases but also applies to more general settings such as
directed graphs, signed graphs, and manifolds with boundary. We propose a new
criterion that identifies to which groups a useful representation should be
invariant and show that this criterion is sufficient to guarantee that the
scattering transform has desirable stability and invariance properties.
Additionally, we consider finite measure spaces that are obtained from randomly
sampling an unknown manifold. We propose two methods for constructing a
data-driven graph on which the associated graph scattering transform
approximates the scattering transform on the underlying manifold. Moreover, we
use a diffusion-maps based approach to prove quantitative estimates on the rate
of convergence of one of these approximations as the number of sample points
tends to infinity. Lastly, we showcase the utility of our method on spherical

increasing sequence of copies of the building block identified at certain
vertices. The members of the frame are then assembled according to different
partitions of the given natural number of given length and specify different
isospectral non-isomorphic graphs. In particular, these graphs are isospectral
for different types of Laplacians: for the standard Laplacian, the signless
standard Laplacian, certain kind of signed Laplacians and, also, for the
(unbounded) Kirchhoff Laplacian of the underlying equilateral metric graph. The
spectrum of the isospectral graphs is determined by the spectrum of the

that every self-adjoint matrix admits a certain type of canonical form under
unitary similarity -- admits analogues over other $*$-algebras distinct from

that there is a consistent way in which many classic matrix decompositions --
such as the Singular Value Decomposition, the Takagi decomposition, the
skew-Takagi decomposition, and the Jordan decomposition, among others -- are
immediate consequences of these. If producing the relevant canonical form of a
self-adjoint matrix were a subroutine in some programming language, then the
corresponding classic matrix decomposition would be a 1-line invocation with no
additional steps. We also suggest that by employing operator overloading in a
programming language, a numerical algorithm for computing a unitary
diagonalisation of a complex self-adjoint matrix would generalise immediately
to solving problems like SVD or Takagi. While algebras without nilpotents (like
the quaternions) allow for similar unifying behaviour, the classic matrix
decompositions which they unify are never obtained as easily. In the process of

eigenvalues, using a previously developed computer program. We obtain all
eigenvalues analytically for not too big graphs that have rationally dependent

diffusion processes modelling a single species that experiences both
demographic and environmental stochasticity. In our setting, the long term
dynamics of the diffusion process in the absence of demographic stochasticity
is determined by the sign of $\Lambda_0$, the external Lyapunov exponent, as
follows: $\Lambda_0<0$ implies (asymptotic) extinction and $\Lambda_0>0$
implies convergence to a unique positive stationary distribution $\mu_0$. If
the system is of size $\frac{1}{\epsilon^{2}}$ for small $\epsilon>0$ (the
intensity of demographic stochasticity), demographic effects will make the
extinction time finite almost surely. This suggests that to understand the
dynamics one should analyze the quasi-stationary distribution (QSD)
$\mu_\epsilon$ of the system. The existence and uniqueness of the QSD is
well-known under mild assumptions.
  We look at what happens when the population size is sent to infinity, i.e.,
when $\epsilon\to 0$. We show that the external Lyapunov exponent still plays a
key role: 1) If $\Lambda_0<0$, then $\mu_\epsilon\to \delta_0$, the mean
extinction time is of order $|\ln \epsilon|$ and the extinction rate associated
with the QSD $\mu_{\epsilon}$ has a lower bound of order
$\frac{1}{|\ln\epsilon|}$; 2) If $\Lambda_0>0$, then $\mu_\epsilon\to \mu_0$,
the mean extinction time is polynomial in $\frac{1}{\epsilon^{2}}$ and the
extinction rate is polynomial in $\epsilon^{2}$. Furthermore, when
$\Lambda_0>0$ we are able to show that the system exhibits multiscale dynamics:
at first the process quickly approaches the QSD $\mu_\epsilon$ and then, after
spending a polynomially long time there, it relaxes to the extinction state. We
give sharp asymptotics in $\epsilon$ for the time spent close to
$\mu_\epsilon$.",59 pages,,,math.PR,"['math.PR', 'math.DS', 'math.SP', 'q-bio.PE', '35Q84, 35J25, 37B25, 60J60']",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08883v1

target signatures received much attention. To understand those methods a
knowledge on the properties of the related eigenvalue problems is essential.
However, even the existence of eigenvalues for such (nonselfadjoint) problems
is a challenging question and existing results for absorbing media are usually
established under unrealistic assumptions or a smoothing of the eigenvalue
problem. We present a technique to prove the existence of infinitely many
eigenvalues for such problems under realistic assumptions. In particular we
consider the class of scalar and modified Maxwell nonselfadjoint Steklov
eigenvalue problems. In addition, we present stability results for the
eigenvalues with respect to changes in the material parameters. In distinction
to existing results the analysis of the present article requires only minimal
regularity assumptions. By that we mean that the regularity of the domain is
not required to be better than Lipschitz, and the material coefficients are
only assumed to be piece-wise $W^{1,\infty}$. Also the stability estimates for

remarkable flexibility of Steklov eigenvalues of planar domains. In the present
paper we extend their result to higher dimensions and to arbitrary manifolds
with boundary, even though in those cases the boundary does not generally
exhibit any periodic structure. Our arguments use framework of variational
eigenvalues and provides a different proof of the original results.
Furthermore, we present an application of this flexibility to the optimisation
of Steklov eigenvalues under perimeter constraint. It is proved that the best
upper bound for normalised Steklov eigenvalues of surfaces of genus zero and
any fixed number of boundary components can always be saturated by planar
domains. This is the case even though any actual maximiser (except for simply
connected surfaces) is always far from being planar themselves. In particular,
it yields sharp upper bound for the first Steklov eigenvalue of doubly
connected planar domains.","11 pages, comments welcome",,,math.SP,"['math.SP', 'math.AP', 'Primary: 58J50, 35P15. Secondary: 35J20, 35B27']",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.02816v1

apply a greedy algorithm which is based on the pivoted QR decomposition of the

self-propagating malware, WannaCry, and present a compartmental model called
SIIDR that accurately captures the behavior observed in real-world attack
traces. Next, we investigate ten cyber defense techniques, including existing
edge and node hardening strategies, as well as newly developed methods based on
reconfiguring network communication (NodeSplit) and isolating communities. We
evaluate all defense strategies in detail using six real-world communication
graphs collected from a large retail network and compare their performance
across a wide range of attacks and network topologies. We show that several of
these defenses are able to efficiently reduce the spread of SPM attacks modeled
with SIIDR. For instance, given a strong attack that infects 97% of nodes when
no defense is employed, strategically securing a small number of nodes (0.08%)
reduces the infection footprint in one of the networks down to 1%.",20 pages,,10.1007/978-3-031-17140-6_26,cs.CR,"['cs.CR', 'math.DS', 'math.SP', 'stat.AP']",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.13594v2

number $z$ and for $U_z$ a solution of $(D_m-z)U_z=0$, the associated PS
operator maps the value of $\Gamma_- U_z$, the MIT bag boundary value of $U_z$,
to $\Gamma_+ U_z$, where $\Gamma_\pm$ are projections along the boundary
$\partial\Omega$ and $(\Gamma_ - + \Gamma_+) = t_{\partial\Omega}$ is the trace
operator on $\partial\Omega$.

pseudodifferential operator and give its principal symbol. In the second part,
we study the PS operator when the mass $m$ is large, and we prove that it fits

semiclassical harmonic oscillators are studied. The starting point of this
research comes from the fact that, in the presence of resonances between
frequencies of the harmonic oscillator and for a generic bounded perturbation,
the set of semiclassical measures for quasimodes of sufficiently small width is
strictly smaller than the corresponding set of semiclassical measures for the
unperturbed system. In this work we precise the description of this set taking
into account the Diophantine properties of the vector of frequencies, the
separation between clusters of eigenvalues in the spectrum produced by the
presence of a perturbation, and the dynamical properties of the classical
Hamiltonian flow generated by the average of the symbol of the perturbation by
the harmonic oscillator flow. In particular, for the perturbed two-dimensional
periodic harmonic oscillator, we characterize the set of semiclassical measures
of quasimodes with a width that is critical for this problem. Two of the main
ingredients in the proof of these results, which are of independent interest,
are: (i) a novel construction of quasimodes based on propagation of coherent
states by several commuting flows and (ii) a general quantum Birkhoff normal

then performing differential gene expression (DGE) to identify genes that vary

types and markers; however, continuous variation within and between cell types

methods for unsupervised feature selection that consider discrete and
continuous transcriptional patterns on an equal footing across multiple scales
simultaneously. Eigenscores ($\text{eig}_i$) rank signals or genes based on
their correspondence to low-frequency intrinsic patterning in the data using
the spectral decomposition of the Laplacian graph. The multiscale Laplacian
score (MLS) is an unsupervised method for locating relevant scales in data and
selecting the genes that are coherently expressed at these respective scales.
The persistent Rayleigh quotient (PRQ) takes data equipped with a filtration,
allowing the separation of genes with different roles in a bifurcation process
(e.g., pseudo-time). We demonstrate the utility of these techniques by applying
them to published single-cell transcriptomics data sets. The methods validate
previously identified genes and detect additional biologically meaningful genes
with coherent expression patterns. By studying the interaction between gene
signals and the geometry of the underlying space, the three methods give
multidimensional rankings of the genes and visualisation of relationships

asymptotic formula for the growth rate of certain $\Gamma$-orbits. In
particular, this allows us to obtain a best-known effective error rate for the
Apollonian and (more generally) Kleinian sphere packing counting problems, that
is, counting the number of spheres in such with radius bounded by a growing
parameter. Our method extends the method of Kontorovich [Kon09], which was
itself an extension of the orbit counting method of Lax-Phillips [LP82], in two
ways. First, we remove a compactness condition on the discrete subgroups
considered via a technical cut-off and smoothing operation. Second, we develop
a coordinate system which naturally corresponds to the inversive geometry
underlying the sphere counting problem, and give structure theorems on the
arising Casimir operator and Haar measure in these coordinates.","38 pages, 4 figures. Added assumption about complementary series

suppose that $0<\alpha<1$. It is easy to see that the eigenvalues belong to
$[0,4]$ and are asymptotically distributed as the function $g(x)=4\sin^2(x/2)$
on $[0,\pi]$. We obtain a series of results about the individual behavior of
the eigenvalues. First, we describe more precisely their localization in
subintervals of $[0,4]$. Second, we transform the characteristic equation to a
form convenient to solve by numerical methods. In particular, we prove that

in a general setting which fully abstains from standard perturbative arguments.
Rather than requiring the matrix to act in a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, we
extend its action to a suitable distributional triple $\mathcal{D} \subset
\mathcal{H} \subset \mathcal{D}_-$ and restrict it to its maximal domain in
$\mathcal{H}$. The crucial point in our approach is the choice of the spaces
$\mathcal{D}$ and $\mathcal{D}_-$ which are essentially determined by the Schur
complement of the matrix. We show spectral equivalence between the resulting
operator matrix in $\mathcal{H}$ and its Schur complement, which allows to pass
from a suitable representation of the Schur complement (e.g. by generalised
form methods) to a representation of the operator matrix. We thereby generalise
classical spectral equivalence results imposing standard dominance patterns.
  The abstract results are applied to damped wave equations with possibly
unbounded and/or singular damping, to Dirac operators with Coulomb-type
potentials, as well as to generic second order matrix differential operators.

relationships are enough to learn meaningful representations. Although SSL has
recently reached a milestone: outperforming supervised methods in many
modalities\dots the theoretical foundations are limited, method-specific, and
fail to provide principled design guidelines to practitioners. In this paper,
we propose a unifying framework under the helm of spectral manifold learning to
address those limitations. Through the course of this study, we will rigorously
demonstrate that VICReg, SimCLR, BarlowTwins et al. correspond to eponymous
spectral methods such as Laplacian Eigenmaps, Multidimensional Scaling et al.
  This unification will then allow us to obtain (i) the closed-form optimal
representation for each method, (ii) the closed-form optimal network parameters
in the linear regime for each method, (iii) the impact of the pairwise
relations used during training on each of those quantities and on downstream
task performances, and most importantly, (iv) the first theoretical bridge
between contrastive and non-contrastive methods towards global and local
spectral embedding methods respectively, hinting at the benefits and
limitations of each. For example, (i) if the pairwise relation is aligned with
the downstream task, any SSL method can be employed successfully and will
recover the supervised method, but in the low data regime, VICReg's invariance
hyper-parameter should be high; (ii) if the pairwise relation is misaligned
with the downstream task, VICReg with small invariance hyper-parameter should
be preferred over SimCLR or BarlowTwins.",,,,cs.LG,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CV', 'math.SP', 'stat.ML']",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.11508v3

a hierarchy of simpler coherent features. DMD is regularly used to understand
the fundamental characteristics of turbulence and is closely related to Koopman
operators. However, verifying the decomposition, equivalently the computed
spectral features of Koopman operators, remains a major challenge due to the
infinite-dimensional nature of Koopman operators. Challenges include spurious
(unphysical) modes, and dealing with continuous spectra, both of which occur
regularly in turbulent flows. Residual Dynamic Mode Decomposition (ResDMD),
introduced by (Colbrook & Townsend 2021), overcomes some of these challenges
through the data-driven computation of residuals associated with the full
infinite-dimensional Koopman operator. ResDMD computes spectra and
pseudospectra of general Koopman operators with error control, and computes
smoothed approximations of spectral measures (including continuous spectra)
with explicit high-order convergence theorems. ResDMD thus provides robust and
verified Koopmanism. We implement ResDMD and demonstrate its application in a
variety of fluid dynamic situations, at varying Reynolds numbers, arising from
both numerical and experimental data. Examples include: vortex shedding behind
a cylinder; hot-wire data acquired in a turbulent boundary layer; particle
image velocimetry data focusing on a wall-jet flow; and acoustic pressure
signals of laser-induced plasma. We present some advantages of ResDMD, namely,
the ability to verifiably resolve non-linear, transient modes, and spectral
calculation with reduced broadening effects. We also discuss how a new modal
ordering based on residuals enables greater accuracy with a smaller dictionary
than the traditional modulus ordering. This paves the way for greater dynamic
compression of large datasets without sacrificing accuracy.",,,10.1017/jfm.2022.1052,physics.flu-dyn,"['physics.flu-dyn', 'cs.LG', 'cs.NA', 'math.DS', 'math.NA', 'math.SP']",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.09779v1

\int_H e_j \, dV_H \right|^2 = C_{H,M} \lambda^{\operatorname{codim} H} +
O(\lambda^{\operatorname{codim} H - 1})$$ where $e_j$ constitute a Hilbert
basis of Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunctions on a Riemannian manifold $M$ with
$\Delta_g e_j = -\lambda_j^2 e_j$, and $H$ is an embedded submanifold. We show
for some suitable definition of `$\sim$', $$ N(\lambda) \sim C_{H,M}

1} + o(\lambda^{\operatorname{codim} H - 1}) $$ where $Q$ is a bounded
oscillating term and is expressed in terms of the geodesics which depart and
arrive $H$ in the normal directions.
  In work by Canzani, Galkowski, and Toth, they establish (as a corollary to a
stronger result involving defect measures) that if the set of recurrent
directions of geodesics normal to $H$ has measure zero, then we obtain improved
bounds on the individual terms in the sum -- the period integrals. We are able
to give a dynamical condition such that $Q$ is uniformly continuous and
`$\sim$' can be replaced with `$=$'. This implies improved bounds on period
integrals, and this condition is weaker than the recurrent directions having
measure zero. Moreover, our result implies improved bounds for period integrals
if there is no $L^1$ measure on $SN^*H$ that is invariant under the first
return map. This generalizes a theorem of Sogge and Zelditch and of Galkowski.","36 pages, 1 figure","A revised version with corrections published online in Comm. Math.

separation of variables that allows us to restrict study to the first two
Fourier modes in an eigenfunction expansion. We show how the nature of the

having the same Kronecker canonical form, up to the eigenvalues (namely, they
are an infinite union of orbits under strict equivalence). The notion of bundle
for matrix pencils was introduced in the 1990's, following the same notion for
matrices under similarity, introduced by Arnold in 1971, and it has been
extensively used since then. Despite the amount of literature devoted to
describing the topology of bundles of matrix pencils, some relevant questions
remain still open in this context. For example, the following two: (a) provide
a characterization for the inclusion relation between the closures (in the
standard topology) of bundles; and (b) are the bundles open in their closure?
The main goal of this paper is providing an explicit answer to these two
questions. In order to get this answer, we also review and/or formalize some
notions and results already existing in the literature. We also prove that
bundles of matrices under similarity, as well as bundles of matrix polynomials
(defined as the set of $m\times n$ matrix polynomials of the same grade having

to possess oscillatory asymptotics which differ substantially from the sorts of
asymptotics observed in the short-range case by Guillarmou, Hassell, Sikora,
and (more recently) Hintz and Vasy. Specifically, the compound asymptotics at
low energy and large spatial scales are more delicate, and the resolvent output
is smooth all the way down to $E=0$. In fact, we will construct a
compactification of $(0,1]_E\times X$ on which the resolvent output is given by
a specified (and relatively complicated) function that oscillates as

zeros. In the case of compact surfaces of constant negative curvature $-1$ the
analytic extension of the Selberg zeta function to the entire complex plane is
classical, and can be achieved using the Selberg trace formula. However, an
alternative dynamical approach is to use the Bowen$\unicode{x2013}$Series
coding on the boundary at infinity to obtain a piecewise analytic expanding map
from which the extension of the zeta function can be obtained using properties
of the associated transfer operator. This latter method has the advantage that
it also applies in the case of infinite area surfaces provided they do not have
cusps. For such examples the location of the zeros is somewhat more mysterious.
However, in particularly simple examples there is a striking structure to the
zeros when we take appropriate limits. We will try to give some insight into
this phenomenon.

means of Mourre's celebrated commutator method, important regularity issues are
known to be inherent to QFT models and restrict the application of this method.
In this perspective, we introduce a novel non-standard construction procedure

allows to circumvent regularity issues. To show its versatility, we apply this
construction to the Nelson model with massive bosons, to Fr\""ohlich's polaron

coincide with those for the zero potential then the number of limits is zero,
i.e. it is possible to retrieve the potential and boundary conditions precisely
in finitely many steps. Otherwise, it is shown that this problem requires a
single limit; moreover, if one has a priori control over how much the
eigenvalues and norming constants differ from those of the zero-potential
problem, and one knows that the average of the potential is zero, then the
computation can be performed with complete error control. This is done in the

Lebesgue measure and that a dense set of them have spectra of zero Hausdorff

a new commutation argument for generating open spectral gaps. This overcomes an
obstacle previously observed in the literature; namely, in Schr\""odinger-type
settings, translation of the spectral measure corresponds to small
$L^\infty$-perturbations of the operator data, but this is not true for Dirac

$H=H_0+CWC$, where $H_0$ is self-adjoint, $W$ is bounded and $C$ is a metric
operator, $C$ bounded and relatively compact with respect to $H_0$. We suppose
that $C(H_0-z)^{-1}C$ is uniformly bounded in
$z\in\mathbb{C}\setminus\mathbb{R}$. We define the spectral singularities of
$H$ as the points of the essential spectrum
$\lambda\in\sigma_{\mathrm{ess}}(H)$ such that $C(H\pm i\varepsilon)^{-1}CW$
does not have a limit as $\varepsilon\to0^+$. We prove that the spectral
singularities of $H$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the eigenvalues,
associated to resonant states, of an extension of $H$ to a larger Hilbert
space. Next, we show that the asymptotically disappearing states for $H$, i.e.
the set of vectors $\varphi$ such that $e^{\pm itH}\varphi\to0$ as
$t\to\infty$, coincide with the generalized eigenstates of $H$ corresponding to
eigenvalues $\lambda\in\mathbb{C}$, $\mp\mathrm{Im}(\lambda)>0$. Finally, we
define the absolutely continuous spectral subspace of $H$ and show that it
satisfies $\mathcal{H}_{\mathrm{ac}}(H)=\mathcal{H}_{\mathrm{p}}(H^*)^\perp$,
where $\mathcal{H}_{\mathrm{p}}(H^*)$ stands for the point spectrum of $H^*$.
We thus obtain a direct sum decomposition of the Hilbert spaces in terms of
spectral subspaces of $H$. One of the main ingredients of our proofs is a
spectral resolution formula for a bounded operator $r(H)$ regularizing the
identity at spectral singularities. Our results apply to Schr\""odinger

Liouville conformal field theory (CFT) with boundaries. We focus here on the
case of the annulus with two boundary insertions, each of which lies on the
different connected components of the boundary. In the course of proving the
bootstrap formula, we established several properties on the corresponding
annulus conformal blocks:
  1) we show that they converge everywhere on the spectral line and they are
continuous with respect to the spectrum and the primary weights.
  2) we relate them to their torus counterparts by rigorously implementing
Cardy's doubling trick for boundary CFT,
  3) we solve a conjecture of Martinec on the annulus partition function,
  4) we also extend the bootstrap formula to the one-point case.
  As an application of our bootstrap result, we give an exact formula for the
bosonic LQG partition function of the annulus when $\gamma\in (0,2)$. Our paper
serves as a key ingredient in the recent derivation of the random moduli for
the Brownian annulus by Ang, Remy, and Sun (2022). We also solve several other

systems in which one factor is periodic and the other factor is either a
subshift over a finite alphabet or an irrational rotation of the circle. In the
case in which one factor is a Boshernitzan subshift, we prove that either the
resulting operators are periodic or the resulting spectra must be Cantor sets.
The main ingredient is a suitable stability result for Boshernitzan's criterion
under taking products. We also discuss the stability of purely singular
continuous spectrum, which, given the zero-measure spectrum result, amounts to
stability results for eigenvalue exclusion. In particular, we examine
situations in which the existing criteria for the exclusion of eigenvalues are
stable under periodic perturbations. As a highlight of this, we show that any
simple Toeplitz subshift over a binary alphabet exhibits uniform absence of
eigenvalues on the hull for any periodic perturbation whose period is
commensurate with the coding sequence. In the case of a full shift, we give an
effective criterion to compute exactly the spectrum of a random Anderson model
perturbed by a potential of period two, and we further show that the naive
generalization of this criterion does not hold for period three. Next, we
consider quasi-periodic potentials with potentials generated by trigonometric
polynomials with periodic background. We show that the quasiperiodic cocycle
induced by passing to blocks of period length is subcritical when the coupling
constant is small and supercritical when the coupling constant is large. Thus,
the spectral type is absolutely continuous for small coupling and pure point

For $\varepsilon>0$ and $n\in\mathbb{N}$ consider the infinite cone
$\Omega_{\varepsilon}:=\big\{(x_1,x')\in (0,\infty)\times\mathbb{R}^n:
x'\in\varepsilon x_1\omega\big\}\subset\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ and the operator
$Q_{\varepsilon}^{\alpha}$ acting as the Laplacian $u\mapsto-\Delta u$ on
$\Omega_{\varepsilon}$ with the Robin boundary condition $\partial_\nu u=\alpha
u$ at $\partial\Omega_\varepsilon$, where $\partial_\nu$ is the outward normal
derivative and $\alpha>0$. We look at the dependence of the eigenvalues of
$Q_\varepsilon^\alpha$ on the parameter $\varepsilon$: this problem was
previously addressed for $n=1$ only (in that case, the only admissible $\omega$
are finite intervals). In the present work we consider arbitrary dimensions
$n\ge2$ and arbitrarily shaped ``cross-sections'' $\omega$ and look at the
spectral asymptotics as $\varepsilon$ becomes small, i.e. as the cone becomes
``sharp'' and collapses to a half-line. It turns out that the main term of the
asymptotics of individual eigenvalues is determined by the single geometric
quantity $N_\omega:=\dfrac{\mathrm{Vol}_{n-1} \partial\omega }{\mathrm{Vol}_n
\omega}$. More precisely, for any fixed $j\in \mathbb{N}$ and $\alpha>0$ the
$j$th eigenvalue $E_j(Q^\alpha_\varepsilon)$ of $Q^\alpha_\varepsilon$ exists
for all sufficiently small $\varepsilon>0$ and satisfies
$E_j(Q^\alpha_\varepsilon)=-\dfrac{N_\omega^2\,\alpha^2}{(2j+n-2)^2\,\varepsilon^2}+O\left(\dfrac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)$

counterparts, as the mesh size tends to zero and up to a natural embedding of
the discrete space into the continuous one. In dimension one we show that
forward-backward differences lead to norm resolvent convergence, while in
dimension two and three they do not. The same negative result holds in all

be true for domains which tile Euclidean space, and, in addition, for some
special domains in higher dimensions. In this paper, we prove P\'{o}lya's

the conjecture is verified. We also confirm P\'{o}lya's conjecture for
arbitrary planar sectors, and, in the Dirichlet case, for balls of any

problems in the disk and certain lattice counting problems. A key novel
ingredient is the observation, made in recent work of the last named author,
that the corresponding eigenvalue and lattice counting functions are related

small-signal stability, evaluates the linkage between a state variable and a
mode. Applying the normal form theory, a nonlinear PF can be defined to
evaluate the participation of a state variable into modal dynamics following a
large disturbance, that gives considerations to resonances and nonlinearities
up to a desired order. However, existing nonlinear PFs are inconsistent with
the conventional linear PF when nonlinear dynamics following a large
disturbance attenuate and linear modal dynamics become dominating. This paper
proposes a time-variant nonlinear PF by introducing a time decaying factor and
the definition of a nonlinear mode. The new PFs consider modes of resonances
and their values naturally transition to a linear PF when the system state
becomes close to its equilibrium. The case study on a two-area four-generator
system shows that the new PF can correctly rank generators by their
participations in natural and resonance modes of nonlinear oscillation subject

the impact of architecture on the performance of a deep network. In particular,
we explain analytically what deep learning practitioners have long observed
empirically: the parameters of some deep architectures (e.g., residual
networks, ResNets, and Dense networks, DenseNets) are easier to optimize than
others (e.g., convolutional networks, ConvNets). Building on our earlier work
connecting deep networks with continuous piecewise-affine splines, we develop
an exact local linear representation of a deep network layer for a family of
modern deep networks that includes ConvNets at one end of a spectrum and
ResNets, DenseNets, and other networks with skip connections at the other. For
regression and classification tasks that optimize the squared-error loss, we
show that the optimization loss surface of a modern deep network is piecewise
quadratic in the parameters, with local shape governed by the singular values
of a matrix that is a function of the local linear representation. We develop
new perturbation results for how the singular values of matrices of this sort
behave as we add a fraction of the identity and multiply by certain diagonal
matrices. A direct application of our perturbation results explains
analytically why a network with skip connections (such as a ResNet or DenseNet)
is easier to optimize than a ConvNet: thanks to its more stable singular values
and smaller condition number, the local loss surface of such a network is less
erratic, less eccentric, and features local minima that are more accommodating
to gradient-based optimization. Our results also shed new light on the impact
of different nonlinear activation functions on a deep network's singular

chains to be upward skip-free, we first establish a gateway relation, a concept
introduced in [26], between the semigroup of such chains and the one of
spectrally negative self-similar Markov processes on $\mathbb{R}_+$. As a
by-product, we prove that each of these Markov chains, after an appropriate
scaling, converge in the Skorohod metric, to the associated self-similar Markov
process. By a linear perturbation of the generator of these Markov chains, we
obtain a class of ergodic Markov chains, which are non-reversible. By means of
intertwining and interweaving relations, where the latter was recently
introduced in [27], we derive several deep analytical properties of such

under small perturbations of a domain, while in the case of the Neumann or
mixed boundary conditions the spectrum may abruptly change. In this work we
discuss an example of such a domain perturbation. Let $\Omega$ be a (not
{necessarily} bounded) domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$. We perturb it to $
\Omega_\varepsilon=\Omega\setminus \cup_{k=1}^m S_{k,\varepsilon},$ where
$S_{k,\varepsilon}$ are closed surfaces with small suitably scaled holes
(``windows'') through which the bounded domains enclosed by these surfaces
(``resonators'') are connected to the outer domain. When $\varepsilon$ goes to
zero, the resonators shrink to points. We prove that in the limit
$\varepsilon\to 0$ the spectrum of the Laplacian on $\Omega_\varepsilon$ with
the Neumann boundary conditions on $S_{k,\varepsilon}$ and the Dirichlet
boundary conditions on the outer boundary converges to the union of the
spectrum of the Dirichlet Laplacian on $\Omega$ and the numbers $\gamma_k$,
$k=1,\dots,m$, being equal $1/4$ times the limit of the ratio between the
capacity of the $k$th window and the volume of the $k$th resonator. We obtain
an estimate on the rate of this convergence with respect to the Hausdorff-type
metrics. Also, an application of this result is presented: we construct an
unbounded waveguide-like domain with inserted resonators such that the
eigenvalues of the Laplacian on this domain lying below the essential spectrum
threshold do coincide with prescribed numbers.",,,,math.SP,"['math.SP', 'math.AP', '35P05, 35P15, 35J05, 35B34']",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.01971v2

regular simplex tensors whose symmetric decomposition is induced by an
overcomplete, equiangular set of $n+1$ vectors from $\mathbb R^n$. We discuss
the full real eigenstructure of such tensors, including the robustness analysis
of all normalized eigenvectors. As it turns out, regular simplex tensors
exhibit robust as well as non-robust eigenvectors which, moreover, only partly

accumulate at the thresholds in the spectrum of $H_0$. Furthermore, we compute
exactly their number and give a precise description on their location in
clusters in the complex plane. If ${\mathfrak G}$ is of infinite dimension, an

Enciso and Peralta-Salas who showed the simplicity for axisymmetric optimal
domains with connected boundary in Euclidean space. We then generalise another

rotationally symmetric optimal domain with connected boundary in Euclidean
space which are closest to the symmetry axis must disconnect the boundary, to
the hyperbolic setting, as well as strengthen it in the Euclidean case by
getting rid of the connected boundary assumption. Lastly, we show how a second

spectrum of a particular selfadjoint realisation coincides with the zeroes of
one entry of the monodromy matrix of the system. Classical function theory thus
establishes an immediate connection between the growth of the monodromy matrix
and the distribution of the spectrum. We prove a generic and flexibel upper
estimate for the monodromy matrix, use it to prove a bound for the case of a

muscle disease that appears between the second and forth decade of a patient's
life, being responsible for 20% of sudden cardiac deaths before the age of 35.
The effective and punctual diagnosis of this disease based on
Electrocardiograms (ECGs) could have a vital role in reducing premature
cardiovascular mortality. In our analysis, we firstly outline the
digitalization process of paper - based ECG signals enhanced by a spatial
filter aiming to eliminate dark regions in the dataset's images that do not
correspond to ECG waveform, producing undesirable noise. Next, we propose the
utilization of a low - complexity convolutional neural network for the
detection of an arrhythmogenic heart disease, that has not been studied through
the usage of deep learning methodology to date, achieving high classification
accuracy, namely 99.98% training and 98.6% testing accuracy, on a disease the
major identification criterion of which are infinitesimal millivolt variations
in the ECG's morphology, in contrast with other arrhythmogenic abnormalities.
Finally, by performing spectral analysis we investigate significant
differentiations in the field of frequencies between normal ECGs and ECGs
corresponding to patients suffering from ARVC. In 16 out of the 18 frequencies
where we encounter statistically significant differentiations, the normal ECGs
are characterized by greater normalized amplitudes compared to the abnormal

regularized Fredholm determinant $\det\nolimits_m(I+A)$ generalizes the
classical Fredholm determinant. Recently, Britz et al presented a proof of a
product formula \[ \det\nolimits_m\bigl( (I+A)\cdot(I+B) \bigr)

polynomial in $A,B$ with values in the trace class operators. If $m=1$ then
$X_1(A,B)=0$, hence the formula generalizes the classical determinant product

  The purpose of this note is to present two very simple alternative proofs of
the formula. The first proof is analytic and makes use of the fact that
$z\mapsto \det\nolimits_m(I+zA)$ is holomorphic, while the second proof is

boundary conditions $Uy :=\{U_1, U_2\}y=0$. If $b_2 = -b_1 =1$ this equation is
equivalent to one dimensional Dirac equation. We show that the system of root
vectors $\{f_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{Z}}$ of the operator $L_U(Q)$ forms a Bari
basis in $L^2([0,1]; \mathbb{C}^2)$ if and only if the unperturbed operator
$L_U(0)$ is self-adjoint. We also give explicit conditions for this in terms of
coefficients in the boundary conditions. The Bari basis criterion is a
consequence of our more general result: Let $Q \in L^p([0,1]; \mathbb{C}^{2

$\{g_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{Z}}$ be the sequence biorthogonal to the system of root

measures $\nu$ on the $d$-dimensional unit cube ($d>1$) via a form approach. We
introduce the notion of the spectral partition function of $\nu$ and, assuming
that the lower $\infty$-dimension of $\nu$ exceeds $d-2$, we show that the
upper Neumann spectral dimension coincides with the unique zero of the spectral
partition function. We show that if the lower $\infty$-dimension of $\nu$ is
strictly less than $d-2$, the form approach breaks down. Examples are given for
the critical case, that is the lower $\infty$-dimension of $\nu$ equals $d-2$,
such that for one case the form approach breaks down, another case, where the
operator is well defined but we have no discrete set of eigenvalues, and for
the third case, where the spectral dimension exists. We provide additional
regularity assumptions on the spectral partition function, guaranteeing that
the Neumann spectral dimension exists and coincides with the Dirichlet spectral
dimension. The significance of our new approach is illustrated by several
prominent examples -- namely absolutely continuous measures, Ahlfors-David
regular measure, and self-conformal measures with or without overlaps -- for
which the spectral partition function is essentially given by its
$L^{q}$-spectrum and both the Dirichlet and Neumann spectral dimensions exist.
Moreover, we provide general bounds for the upper Neumann spectral dimension in
terms of the upper Minkowski dimension of the support of $\nu$ and its lower
$\infty$-dimension. Finally, we give an example for which the spectral
dimension does not exist.","77 pages, 5 figures",,,math.SP,"['math.SP', 'math.FA', 'math.OC', '35P20, 35J05, 28A80, 42B35, 45D05']",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.05247v4

real-world data usually contain measurements with uncertainties and artifacts,
the input space in the proposed framework consists of probability distributions

dimensionality reduction framework, called NGEU, which leverages uncertainty
information and directly extends several traditional approaches, e.g., KPCA,

original data. We show that the proposed NGEU formulation exhibits a global

of generators relative to the Schatten-von Neumann ideals on Hilbert spaces.
This allows us to develop a graded family of equivalence relations on
generators, which refine the classical notion and provide

Schr\""odinger operators on the $d$-dimensional hyperbolic space of constant
curvature $-\kappa^2$ are flexible enough to approximate an arbitrary solution
of the Helmholtz equation $\Delta h+h=0$ on $\mathbf{R}^d$, over the natural
length scale $O(\lambda^{-1/2})$ determined by the eigenvalue $\lambda \gg 1$.
This problem is motivated by the fact that, by the asymptotics of the local
Weyl law, approximate Laplace eigenfunctions do have this approximation
property on any compact Riemannian manifold. In this paper we are specifically
interested in the Coulomb and harmonic oscillator operators on the hyperbolic
spaces $\mathbf{H}^d(\kappa)$. As the dimension of the space of bound states of
these operators tends to infinity as $\kappa$ tends to 0, one can hope to
approximate solutions to the Helmholtz equation by eigenfunctions for some
$\kappa > 0$ that is not fixed a priori. Our main result shows that this is
indeed the case, under suitable hypotheses. We also prove a global
approximation theorem with decay for the Helmholtz equation on manifolds that
are isometric to the hyperbolic space outside a compact set, and consider an
application to the study of the heat equation on $\mathbf{H}^d(\kappa)$.
Although global approximation and inverse approximation results are
heuristically related in that both theorems explore flexibility properties of
solutions to elliptic equations on hyperbolic spaces, we will see that the

Formulas obtained are essentially different for relatively small and large
diagonal elements $b_{n}$.
  Our analysis is intimately linked with spectral theory of Jacobi operators
$J$ with coefficients $a_{n}, b_{n}$ and a study of the corresponding second
order difference equations.
  We introduce the Jost solutions $f_{n}(z)$, $n\geq -1$, of such equations by
a condition for $n\to\infty$ and suggest an Ansatz for them playing the role of
the semiclassical Liouville-Green Ansatz for solutions of the Schr\""odinger

  This allows us to study the spectral structure of Jacobi operators and their
eigenfunctions $P_{n}(z)$ by traditional methods of spectral theory developed
for differential equations. In particular, we express all coefficients in
asymptotic formulas for $P_{n}(z)$ as $n \to\infty$ in terms of the Wronskian
of the solutions $ P_{n} (z) $ and $ f_{n} (z)$. The formulas obtained for

well-received in the era of big data. However, singular value decomposition
(SVD) is only for order-two data, i.e., matrices. It is necessary to flatten a
higher order input into a matrix or break it into a series of order-two slices
to tackle higher order data such as multispectral images and videos with the
SVD. Higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) extends the SVD and can
approximate higher order data using sums of a few rank-one components. We
consider the problem of generalizing HOSVD over a finite dimensional
commutative algebra. This algebra, referred to as a t-algebra, generalizes the
field of complex numbers. The elements of the algebra, called t-scalars, are
fix-sized arrays of complex numbers. One can generalize matrices and tensors
over t-scalars and then extend many canonical matrix and tensor algorithms,
including HOSVD, to obtain higher-performance versions. The generalization of
HOSVD is called THOSVD. Its performance of approximating multi-way data can be
further improved by an alternating algorithm. THOSVD also unifies a wide range
of principal component analysis algorithms. To exploit the potential of
generalized algorithms using t-scalars for approximating images, we use a pixel
neighborhood strategy to convert each pixel to ""deeper-order"" t-scalar.
Experiments on publicly available images show that the generalized algorithm
over t-scalars, namely THOSVD, compares favorably with its canonical
counterparts.","21 pages, 11 figures, several typos in the appendix corrected",,,cs.LG,"['cs.LG', 'cs.IT', 'math.AC', 'math.IT', 'math.RT', 'math.SP']",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.00450v8

properties of these filters and show that they are linear and shift-invariant,
as well as permutation and orientation equivariant. These filters can also be
implemented in a distributed fashion with a low computational complexity, as
they involve only (multiple rounds of) simplicial shifting between upper and
lower adjacent simplices. Second, focusing on edge-flows, we study the
frequency responses of these filters and examine how we can use the
Hodge-decomposition to delineate gradient, curl and harmonic frequencies. We
discuss how these frequencies correspond to the lower- and the upper-adjacent
couplings and the kernel of the Hodge Laplacian, respectively, and can be tuned
independently by our filter designs. Third, we study different procedures for
designing simplicial convolutional filters and discuss their relative
advantages. Finally, we corroborate our simplicial filters in several

to denoise edge flows, and to analyze financial markets and traffic networks.","16 pages, 13 figures, 2 tables",,10.1109/TSP.2022.3207045,eess.SP,"['eess.SP', 'cs.LG', 'cs.SI', 'math.AT', 'math.SP']",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11720v2

non-selfadjoint Baouendi-Grushin operator on the two-dimensional torus
$\mathbb{T}^2=\mathbb{R}^2/(2\pi\mathbb{Z})^2$ with H\""older dampings. The
operator is subelliptic degenerating along the vertical direction at $x=0$. We
exhibit three different situations:
  (i) the damping region verifies the geometric control condition with respect
to both the non-degenerate Hamiltonian flow and the vertical subelliptic flow;
  (ii) the undamped region contains a horizontal strip;
  (iii) the undamped part is a line. In all of these situations, we obtain
sharp resolvent estimates. Consequently, we prove the optimal energy decay rate
for the associated damped waved equations. For (i) and (iii), our results are
in sharp contrast to the Laplace resolvent since the optimal bound is governed
by the quasimodes in the subelliptic regime. While for (ii), the optimality is
governed by the quasimodes in the elliptic regime, and the optimal energy decay
rate is the same as for the classical damped wave equation on $\mathbb{T}^2$.
  Our analysis contains the study of adapted two-microlocal semiclassical
measures, construction of quasimodes and refined Birkhoff normal-form
reductions in different regions of the phase-space. Of independent interest, we
also obtain the propagation theorem for semiclassical measures of quasimodes
microlocalized in the subelliptic regime.","91 pages, to appear in Comm. Math. Physics",,10.1007/s00220-022-04606-4,math.AP,"['math.AP', 'math.OC', 'math.SP']",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.08189v2

problem' for the time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation, that is, find a global
solution $u(z, t)$ of $Pu = 0$ having prescribed asymptotics as $t \to \infty$.

The spectrum admits a systematic double multiplicity, and after removing it we
study the gaps in the resulting desymmetrized spectrum. We show a spectral gap
property, that there are arbitrarily large gaps, and also arbitrarily small
ones, moreover that the nearest neighbour spacing distribution of the
desymmetrized spectrum is a delta function at the origin. We show that for

functional on the space of equipartitions of the manifold, and the other in
terms of a two-sided Dirichlet-to-Neumann map defined on the nodal set. We
relate these two approaches by giving an explicit formula for the Hessian of
the equipartition energy in terms of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. This allows
us to compute Hessian eigenfunctions, and hence directions of steepest descent,

precise, such matrix sequences arise when we numerically approximate some
partial differential equations by discretization. The study of the asymptotic
spectral behaviour of GLT sequence is very important in analysing the solution
of corresponding partial differential equations. The approximating classes of
sequences (a.c.s) and the spectral symbols are important notions in this
connection. Recently, G. Barbarino obtained some additional results regarding
the theoretical aspects of such notions. He obtained the completeness of the
space of matrix sequences with respect to pseudo metric a.c.s. Also, he
identified the space of GLT sequences with the space of measurable functions.
In this article, we follow the same research line and obtain various results
connecting the sub-algebras of matrix sequence spaces and sub-algebras of
function spaces. In some cases, these are identifications as Banach spaces and
some of them are Banach algebra identifications. In the process, we also prove
that the convergence notions in the sense of eigenvalue/singular value
clustering are equivalent to the convergence with respect to the metrics

operator $S=S_h$ defined on a Hilbert subspace of $L^2(Y)$ that parameterizes
the continuous spectrum of $P$ at energy $1$. Here $Y$ is the cross section of

$\mathcal{D}_\kappa\subset T^*Y$. The scattering map $\kappa$ and its domain
$\mathcal{D}_\kappa$ are determined by the Hamilton flow of the principal
symbol of $P$. As an application we prove that, under additional hypotheses on
the scattering map, the eigenvalues of the associated unitary scattering matrix
are equidistributed on the unit circle.","Version 2 has an additional subsection in the appendix, in which we

Darboux transformations of the Bessel, Airy, and exponential bispectral
functions give rise to commuting integral and differential operators [6, 7, 8],
vastly generalizing the known examples in the literature. In this paper, we
give a classification of the the rational symmetric Darboux transformations of
the Airy function in terms of the fixed point submanifold of a differential
Galois group acting on the Lagrangian locus of the (infinite dimensional) Airy
Adelic Grassmannian and initiate the study of the full algebra of differential
operators commuting with each of the integral operators in question. We
leverage the general theory of [8] to obtain explicit formulas for the two
differential operators of lowest orders that commute with each of the level one

Application to the Timoshenko beam model,"Anton A. Lunyov, Mark M. Malamud","The paper is concerned with the following $n\times n$ Dirac type
equation$$Ly=-iB(x)^{-1}(y'+Q(x)y)=\lambda y, \quad B(x)=B(x)^*,\quad y={\rm
col}(y_1,\ldots,y_n),\quad x\in[0,\ell],$$ on a finite interval $[0,\ell]$.
Here $Q$ is a summable potential $n\times n$ matrix function and $B$ is an
invertible self-adjoint diagonal bounded matrix function. If $n=2m$ and
$B(x)={\rm diag}(-I_m,I_m)$, this equation is equivalent to Dirac equation of
order $n$.
  We show the existence of triangular transformation operators for such
equation under additional uniform separation conditions on the entries of the
matrix function $B$. Here we apply this result to study direct spectral
properties of the boundary value problem (BVP) associated with the above
equation subject to the general boundary conditions $U(y)=Cy(0)+Dy(\ell)=0,{\rm
rank}(C\ D)=n$.
  We apply this result to show that the deviation of the characteristic
determinants of this BVP and the unperturbed BVP (with $Q=0$) is a Fourier
transform of some summable function, which in turn yields asymptotic behavior
of the spectrum in the case of regular boundary conditions. Namely,
$\lambda_m=\lambda_m^0+o(1)$ as $m\to\infty$, where
$\{\lambda_m\}_{m\in\mathbb{Z}}$ and $\{\lambda_m^0\}_{m\in\mathbb{Z}}$ are
sequences of eigenvalues of perturbed and unperturbed ($Q=0$) BVP,
respectively.
  Further, we prove that the system of root vectors of the above BVP
constitutes a Riesz basis in a certain weighted $L^2$-space, provided that the
boundary conditions are strictly regular.
  The main results are applied to establish asymptotic behavior of eigenvalues
and eigenvectors, and the Riesz basis property for the dynamic generator of the
Timoshenko beam model. We also found a new case when eigenvalues have an
explicit asymptotic, which to the best of our knowledge is new even in the case

Colbrook, Andrew Horning, Kyle Thicke, Alexander B. Watson","Topological insulators (TIs) are renowned for their remarkable electronic
properties: quantised bulk Hall and edge conductivities, and robust edge
wave-packet propagation, even in the presence of material defects and disorder.
Computations of these physical properties generally rely on artificial
periodicity (the supercell approximation), or unphysical boundary conditions
(artificial truncation). In this work, we build on recently developed methods
for computing spectral properties of infinite-dimensional operators. We apply
these techniques to develop efficient and accurate computational tools for
computing the physical properties of TIs. These tools completely avoid such
artificial restrictions and allow one to probe the spectral properties of the
infinite-dimensional operator directly, even in the presence of material
defects and disorder. Our methods permit computation of spectra, approximate
eigenstates, spectral measures, spectral projections, transport properties, and
conductances. Numerical examples are given for the Haldane model, and the
techniques can be extended similarly to other TIs in two and three dimensions.",,,,math.NA,"['math.NA', 'cond-mat.mes-hall', 'cs.NA', 'math-ph', 'math.MP', 'math.SP']",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.03942v1

asymptotically the number of excursions (finite paths in the cone with fixed
length, starting and ending points, using jumps from a given step set). As it
turns out, the associated critical exponent is related to the eigenvalues of a
certain Dirichlet problem on a spherical domain. An important underlying
question is to decide whether this asymptotic exponent is a (non-)rational
number, as this has important consequences on the algebraic nature of the
associated generating function. In this paper, we ask whether such an excursion
sequence might admit an asymptotic expansion with a first rational exponent and
a second non-rational exponent. While the current state of the art does not
give any access to such many-term expansions, we look at the associated
continuous problem, involving Brownian motion in cones. Our main result is to
prove that in dimension three, there exists a cone such that the heat kernel
(the continuous analogue of the excursion sequence) has the desired
rational/non-rational asymptotic property. Our techniques come from spectral
theory and perturbation theory. More specifically, our main tool is a new
Hadamard formula, which has an independent interest and allows us to compute
the derivative of eigenvalues of spherical triangles along infinitesimal
variations of the angles.","23 pages, 5 figures",,,math.CO,"['math.CO', 'math.PR', 'math.SP']",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.03567v1

space into three regions: a supercritical region and a subcritical region that
are dual to one another, and a critical regime that is self-dual. In each
parameter region, we characterize the cocycle dynamics of the transfer matrix
cocycle generated by the associated generalized eigenvalue equation. In
particular, we show that supercritical, critical, and subcritical behavior all
occur in this model. Using Avila's global theory of one-frequency cocycles, we
exactly compute the Lyapunov exponent on the spectrum in terms of the given
parameters. We also characterize the spectral type for each value of the
coupling constant, almost every frequency, and almost every phase. Namely, we
show that for almost every frequency and every phase the spectral type is
purely absolutely continuous in the subcritical region, pure point in the
supercritical region, and purely singular continuous in the critical region. In
some parameter regions, we refine the almost-sure results. In the critical case
for instance, we show that the spectrum is a Cantor set of zero Lebesgue

If, in addition, the surface area is sufficiently small, then the stationary
point is a minimum.

energy and distance Laplacian energy for graphs with diameter 2. We obtain
lower bounds for the distance Laplacian energy $DLE(G)$ in terms of the order
$n$, the Wiener index $W(G)$, independence number, vertex connectivity number
and other given parameters. We characterize the extremal graphs attaining these
bounds. We show that the complete bipartite graph has the minimum distance
Laplacian energy among all connected bipartite graphs and complete split graph
has the minimum distance Laplacian energy among all connected graphs with given

Colbrook, Alex Townsend","Koopman operators are infinite-dimensional operators that globally linearize
nonlinear dynamical systems, making their spectral information valuable for
understanding dynamics. However, Koopman operators can have continuous spectra
and infinite-dimensional invariant subspaces, making computing their spectral
information a considerable challenge. This paper describes data-driven
algorithms with rigorous convergence guarantees for computing spectral
information of Koopman operators from trajectory data. We introduce residual
dynamic mode decomposition (ResDMD), which provides the first scheme for
computing the spectra and pseudospectra of general Koopman operators from
snapshot data without spectral pollution. Using the resolvent operator and
ResDMD, we compute smoothed approximations of spectral measures associated with
general measure-preserving dynamical systems. We prove explicit convergence
theorems for our algorithms, which can achieve high-order convergence even for
chaotic systems when computing the density of the continuous spectrum and the
discrete spectrum. Since our algorithms come with error control, ResDMD allows
aposteri verification of spectral quantities, Koopman mode decompositions, and
learned dictionaries. We demonstrate our algorithms on the tent map, circle
rotations, Gauss iterated map, nonlinear pendulum, double pendulum, and Lorenz
system. Finally, we provide kernelized variants of our algorithms for dynamical
systems with a high-dimensional state space. This allows us to compute the

eigenvalue of the Laplacian among all closed hyperbolic surfaces of genus $3$,

way, we show that for every $g\geq 2$, there exists some $\delta_g>0$ such that
the multiplicity of any eigenvalue of the Laplacian on a closed hyperbolic
surface of genus $g$ in the interval $[0,1/4+\delta_g]$ is at most $2g-1$

applications of a given quantum operation, e.g.~a measurement, used to restrict
the time evolution (due e.g.~to decoherence) to states that are invariant under
the quantum operation. In an abstract setting, the Zeno sequence is an
alternating concatenation of a contraction operator (quantum operation) and a
$C_0$-contraction semigroup (time evolution) on a Banach space. In this paper,
we prove the optimal convergence rate of order $\tfrac{1}{n}$ of the Zeno
sequence by proving explicit error bounds. For that, we derive a new
Chernoff-type $\sqrt{n}$-Lemma, which we believe to be of independent interest.
Moreover, we generalize the convergence result for the Zeno effect in two
directions: We weaken the assumptions on the generator, inducing the Zeno
dynamics generated by an unbounded generator and we improve the convergence to
the uniform topology. Finally, we provide a large class of examples arising

time-fractional PDEs. The method inverts the Laplace transform via an optimised
stable quadrature rule, suitable for infinite-dimensional operators, whose
error decreases like $\exp(-cN/\log(N))$ for $N$ quadrature points. The method
is parallisable, avoids having to resolve singularities of the solution as
$t\downarrow 0$, and avoids the large memory consumption that can be a
challenge for time-stepping methods applied to time-fractional PDEs. The ODEs
resulting from quadrature are solved using adaptive sparse spectral methods
that converge exponentially with optimal linear complexity. These solutions of
ODEs are reused for different times. We provide a complete analysis of our
approach for fractional beam equations used to model small-amplitude vibration
of viscoelastic materials with a fractional Kelvin-Voigt stress-strain
relationship. We calculate the system's energy evolution over time and the
surface deformation in cases of both constant and non-constant viscoelastic
parameters. An infinite-dimensional ``solve-then-discretise'' approach
considerably simplifies the analysis, which studies the generalisation of the
numerical range of a quasi-linearisation of a suitable operator pencil. This
allows us to build an efficient algorithm with explicit error control. The
approach can be readily adapted to other time-fractional PDEs and is not
constrained to fractional parameters in the range $0<\nu<1$.",,,10.1016/j.jcp.2022.110995,math.NA,"['math.NA', 'cs.NA', 'math.AP', 'math.CV', 'math.SP', 'physics.flu-dyn']",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.13070v1

`generic' manifold, the behavior seems to be different: both numerics and
Berry's random wave model suggest $\| \phi_k\|_{L^{\infty}} \lesssim
\sqrt{\log{\lambda_k}}$ as the typical behavior. We propose a mechanism,
centered around an $L^1-$analogue of the spectral projector, for explaining the
slow growth in the generic case: for $\phi_{n+1}(x_0)$ to be large, it is
necessary that either (1) several of the first $n$ eigenfunctions were large in
$x_0$ or (2) that $\phi_{n+1}$ is strongly correlated with a suitable linear
combination of the first $n$ eigenfunctions on most of the manifold or (3)
both. An interesting byproduct is quantum entanglement for Laplacian
eigenfunctions: the existence of two distinct points $x,y \in M$ such that the
sequences $(\phi_k(x))_{k=1}^{\infty}$ and $(\phi_k(y))_{k=1}^{\infty}$ do not
behave like independent random variables. The existence of such points is not

  In the case of ergodic operators, one can use large deviation estimates for
the Green function in finite volumes to verify the assumptions of our general
theorem. Such estimates have been proved for numerous classes of quasiperiodic
operators in one and higher dimension, starting from the works of Bourgain,
Goldstein, and Schlag.
  One of the applications is a power-logarithmic bound on the quantum transport
defined by a multidimensional discrete Schr\""odinger (or even long-range)
operator associated with an irrational shift, valid for all Diophantine
frequencies and uniformly for all phases. To the best of our knowledge, these
are the first results on the quantum dynamics for quasiperiodic operators in
dimension greater than one that do not require exclusion of a positive measure
of phases. Moreover, and in contrast to localisation, the estimates are uniform
in the phase.

is sufficiently high) this eigenvector is robust, i.e., it is an attracting
fixed point of the tensor power method. We exhibit new classes of symmetric
tensors whose symmetric decomposition consists of eigenvectors. Generalizing
orthogonally decomposable tensors, we consider equiangular tight frame
decomposable and equiangular set decomposable tensors. Our main result implies
that such tensors can be decomposed using the tensor power method.",,,,math.NA,"['math.NA', 'cs.NA', 'math.AG', 'math.SP']",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.06880v2

flat torus $\mathbf{T}_\Gamma:=\mathbf{R}^d/\Gamma$ are flexible enough to
approximate, over the natural length scale of order $1/\sqrt\lambda$, where
$\lambda\gg1$ is the eigenvalue, an arbitary solution of the Helmholtz equation
$\Delta h + h=0$ on $\mathbf{R}^d$. This problem is motivated by the fact that,
by the asymptotics for the local Weyl law, ""approximate Laplace eigenfunctions""
do have this approximation property on any compact Riemannian manifold. What we
find is that the answer depends solely on the arithmetic properties of the
spectrum. Specifically, recall that the eigenvalues of $\mathbf{T}_\Gamma$ are
of the form $\lambda_k=Q_\Gamma(k)$, where $Q_\Gamma$ is a quadratic form and
$k \in \mathbf{Z}^d$. Our main result is that the eigenfunctions of
$\mathbf{T}_\Gamma$ have the desired approximation property if and only
$Q_\Gamma$ is a multiple of a quadratic form with integer coefficients. In
particular, the set of lattices $\Gamma$ for which this approximation property
holds has measure zero but includes all rational lattices. A consequence of
this fact is that when $Q_\Gamma$ is a multiple of a quadratic form with
integer coefficients, Laplace eigenfunctions exhibit an extremely flexible
behavior over scales of order $1/\sqrt\lambda$. In particular, there are
eigenfunctions of arbitrarily high energy that exhibit nodal components
diffeomorphic to any compact hypersurface of diameter $O(1/\sqrt\lambda)$.",,,,math.SP,['math.SP'],http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.06810v1

determining the container shape that maximizes the fundamental sloshing
frequency among two classes of shallow containers: symmetric canals with a
given free surface width and cross-sectional area, and radially symmetric
containers with a given rim radius and volume [doi:10.1002/cpa.3160180124].
Here, we extend these results in two ways: (i) we consider surface tension
effects on the fluid free surface, assuming a flat equilibrium free surface
together with a pinned contact line, and (ii) we consider sinusoidal waves
traveling along the canal with wavenumber $\alpha\ge 0$ and spatial period
$2\pi/\alpha$; two-dimensional sloshing corresponds to the case $\alpha = 0$.
Generalizing our recent variational characterization of fluid sloshing with
surface tension to the case of a pinned contact line, we derive the pinned-edge
linear shallow sloshing problem, which is an eigenvalue problem for a
generalized Sturm-Liouville system. In the case without surface tension, we
show that the optimal shallow canal is a rectangular canal for any $\alpha >
0$. In the presence of surface tension, we solve for the maximizing
cross-section explicitly for shallow canals with any given $\alpha\ge 0$ and
shallow radially symmetric containers with $m$ azimuthal nodal lines, $m = 0,
1$. Our results reveal that the squared maximal sloshing frequency increases
considerably as surface tension increases. Interestingly, both the optimal
shallow canal for $\alpha = 0$ and the optimal shallow radially symmetric
container are not convex. As a consequence of our explicit solutions, we
establish convergence of the maximizing cross-sections, as surface tension
vanishes, to the maximizing cross-sections without surface tension.","25 pages, 3 figures; comments welcome! In the updated arXiv version,

root spaces of the eigenvalues $(s - r_z)^{-1}$ and complex-analytic properties

The functions $r_z,$ called coupling resonances, are important in the spectral
analysis of $H_0 + r V$ for any real number $r.$ For instance, they afford a
description of the spectral shift function (SSF) of the pair $H_0$ and $V,$ as
well as the absolutely continuous and singular parts of the SSF. A thorough
study of real-valued coupling resonances $r_\lambda$ for real $\lambda$ outside

Cantor set of zero lower box counting dimension, and hence in particular of
zero Hausdorff dimension, while still retaining the singular continuity of the

fixing the off-diagonal coefficients and varying only the diagonal

Laplace eigenvalues can be explicitly computed. In 1964, Milnor used a
construction of Witt to find an example of isospectral non-isometric Riemannian
manifolds, a striking and concise result that occupied one page in the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Science of the USA. Milnor's example is
a pair of 16-dimensional flat tori, whose set of Laplace eigenvalues are
identical, in spite of the fact that these tori are not isometric. A natural
question is: what is the \em lowest \em dimension in which such isospectral
non-isometric pairs exist? This isospectral question for flat tori can be
equivalently formulated in analytic, geometric, and number theoretic language.

vanish (for appropriately chosen frequencies) whenever the gauge function tends
to zero faster than logarithmically. For arbitrary coupling, we show that
modulus of continuity of the integrated density of states can be arbitrary
close to logarithmic; we also prove a similar result for the Lyapunov exponent

with the diffusion coefficient and tending to infinity for diffusion tending to
infinity, and (iii) asymptotic state for times up to $T = \infty$. In this
paper we focus on uniform error estimates in the long-time case. Using
linearization at a time-dependent shadow solution, we derive sufficient
conditions for control of the errors. The employed methods are cut-off
techniques and $L^p$-estimates combined with stability conditions for the

the Hamiltonian that represents the propagation of transverse electric waves.
In this second paper, we use this transform to prove the limiting absorption

the resolvent near the continuous spectrum and the long time response of the
medium to a time-harmonic source of prescribed frequency. This paper also
underlines the existence of an interface resonance which occurs when there
exists a particular frequency characterized by a ratio of permittivities and
permeabilities equal to $-1$ across the interface. At this frequency, the
response of the system to a harmonic forcing term blows up linearly in time.
Such a resonance is unusual for wave problem in unbounded domains and
corresponds to a non-zero embedded eigenvalue of infinite multiplicity of the

$\lambda(\Delta_p)$, the function $p\mapsto p(2\lambda(\Delta_p))^{\frac1p}$ is
locally increasing, while the function $p\mapsto 2^{-p}\lambda(\Delta_p)$ is
locally decreasing. As a special class of homological eigenvalues, the min-max
eigenvalues $\lambda_1(\Delta_p)$, $\cdots$, $\lambda_k(\Delta_p)$, $\cdots$,

establish the monotonicity of $p(2\lambda_k(\Delta_p))^{\frac1p}$ and
$2^{-p}\lambda_k(\Delta_p)$ with respect to $p\in[1,+\infty)$.

of the Neumann-Poincar\'e operators on a sequence of the prolate spheroids is
densely distributed in the interval [0,1/2] as their eccentricities tend to 1,
namely, as they become longer. We then prove that eigenvalues of the

in the interval [-1/2, 1/2] as the ellipsoids become flatter. In particular,
this shows that even if there are at most finitely many negative eigenvalues on

ethnic group, nationality, etc., whereas high frequencies account for personal
characteristics. Individuals are then seen by observers as the output of a
filter that emphasizes a certain range of high or low frequencies. The
selection of the filter depends on the social distance between the observing
individual or group and the person being observed as well as on motivation,
cognitive resources and cultural background. Enhancing low- or high-frequency
harmonics is not on equal footing, the latter requiring supplementary energy.
This mirrors a well-known property of signal processing filters. More
generally, in the light of this correspondence, we show that several
established results of social cognition admit a natural interpretation and
integration in the signal processing language. While the potential of this
connection between an area of social psychology and one of information
engineering appears considerable (compression, information retrieval,
filtering, feedback, feedforward, sampling, aliasing, etc.), in this paper we
shall limit ourselves to laying down what we consider the pillars of this
bridge on which future research may be founded.",,,,math.SP,['math.SP'],http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.14338v1

error term in lower dimensions is a famous open problem (e.g. Gauss circle
problem). In this paper, we show that under a type of singular perturbations
one can obtain the pointwise Weyl law with a sharp error term in any

optimal rate $\frac{\log k}{k}$. This result appears to provide the first
examples of free boundary minimal surfaces in a compact domain converging to
closed minimal surfaces in the boundary, suggesting new directions in the study

the subleading polynomial corrections can be identified in terms of the Laurent

law, where $d=\dim M$. Given a dynamical assumption implying additional local
regularity, Duistermaat and Guillemin improve this to $o(\sigma^{d-1})$. By
examining the Tauberian step in the argument, we show how a quantitative
version \[N(\sigma) = Z(\sigma) + O(\sigma^{d-1}\mathcal{R}(\sigma)^{-1/2})\]

growth rate of $\langle D_\tau \rangle^{1-d}
\tau^{-1}\operatorname{HWT}_{M,g}(\tau)$ as measured in $L^{1,1}$. Per
Duistermaat-Guillemin, this hypothesis is implied by geometric conditions that
hold ``generically'' for $d\geq 3$. Thus, we clarify the relation between the

orthogonal Bergman projector associated with high tensor powers of a positive
line bundle. More precisely, for a fixed complex submanifold in a complex
manifold, we consider the operator which associates to a given holomorphic
section of a positive line bundle over the submanifold the holomorphic
extension of it to the ambient manifold with the minimal $L^2$-norm. When the
tensor power of the line bundle tends to infinity, we obtain an explicit
asymptotic expansion of this operator.
  This is done by proving an exponential estimate for the Schwartz kernel of
the extension operator, and showing that this Schwartz kernel admits a full
asymptotic expansion in powers of the line bundle for close parameters. Along
the way we prove similar results for the projection onto the holomorphic
sections orthogonal to those which vanish along the submanifold. Motivated by
possible applications to the invariance of plurigenera problem, our results are
proved for manifolds and embeddings of bounded geometry.

$\log$-probability of the upper tail event of $\lambda(\mathbb{G}(n,p))$ equals
to that of planting a clique of an appropriate size (upon ignoring smaller
order terms), while for $p \ll n^{-2/3}$ the same is given by that of the
existence of a high degree vertex. This, in particular, shows an emergence of
{\em non-planted localized structure} in the latter regime. We also confirm
that in the entire regime \eqref{eq:abs} the large deviation probability is
asymptotically approximated by the solution of the mean-field variational

existence of an optimizing potential for each $N$, discuss its qualitative
properties and the Euler--Lagrange equation (which is a system of coupled
nonlinear Schr\""odinger equations) and study in detail the behavior of
optimizing sequences. In particular, under the condition
$\gamma>\max\{0,2-d/2\}$ on the Riesz exponent in the inequality, we prove the

that the optimal Lieb-Thirring constant cannot be stationary in $N$, which

self-adjoint operator $V,$ the functions $r_j(z) = - \sigma_j^{-1}(z),$ where
$\sigma_j(z)$ are eigenvalues of the compact operator $(H_0-z)^{-1}V,$ bear a
lot of important information about the pair $H_0$ and $V.$ We call them
coupling resonances. In case of rank one (and positive) perturbation $V,$ there
is only one coupling resonance function, which is a Herglotz function. This
case has been studied in depth in the literature, and appears in different
situations, such as Sturm-Liouville theory, random Schr\""odinger operators,
harnomic and spectral analyses, etc. The general case is complicated by the
fact that the resonance functions are no longer single valued holomorphic
functions, and potentially can have quite an erratic behaviour, typical for
infinitely-valued holomorphic functions. Of special interest are those coupling
resonance functions $r_z$ which approach a real number $r_{\lambda+i0}$ from
the interval $[0,1]$ as the spectral parameter $z=\lambda+iy$ approaches a
point $\lambda$ of the essential spectrum, since they are responsible for
spectral flow through $\lambda$ inside essential spectrum when $H_0$ gets
deformed to $H_1 = H_0+V$ via the path $H_0 + rV, r \in [0,1].$
  In this paper it is shown that if the pair $H_0,$ $V$ satisfies the limiting
absorption principle, then the coupling resonance functions are well-behaved
near the essential spectrum in the following sense. Let $I$ be an open interval
inside the essential spectrum of $H_0$ and $\epsilon>0.$ Then there exists a
compact subset~$K$ of~$I$ such that $| I \setminus K | < \epsilon,$ and $K$ has
a ""non-tangential"" neighbourhood in the upper complex half-plane, such that any
coupling resonance function is either single-valued in the neighbourhood, or
does not take a real value in the interval $[0,1].$",7 pages,,,math.SP,"['math.SP', 'math-ph', 'math.MP', '47A40']",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.04675v1

with the continuum Dirac operators in the same Hilbert space $L^2(\mathbb
R^2)^2$. In particular, we prove that the discrete Dirac operators converge to
the continuum Dirac operators in the strong resolvent sense. Potentials are
assumed to be bounded and uniformly continuous functions on $\mathbb R^2$ and
allowed to be complex matrix-valued. We also prove that the discrete Dirac
operators do not converge to the continuum Dirac operators in the norm
resolvent sense. This is closely related to the observation that the Liouville

spectrum initiated in \cite{AzSFIES}. Given a point $\lambda$ outside the
essential spectrum of a self-adjoint operator $H_0,$ the resonance set,
$\mathcal R(\lambda),$ is an analytic variety which consists of self-adjoint
relatively compact perturbations $H_0+V$ of $H_0,$ for which $\lambda$ is an
eigenvalue. One may ask for criteria for the vector $V$ to be tangent to the
resonance set. Such criteria were given in \cite{AzSFnRI}.
  In this paper we study similar criteria for the case of $\lambda$ inside the
essential spectrum of $H_0.$ For the case $\lambda \in \sigma_{ess}(H_0)$ the
resonance set is defined in terms of the well-known limiting absorption
principle. Among the results of this paper is that the resonance set contains
plenty of straight lines, moreover, given any regular relatively compact
perturbation $V$ there exists a finite rank self-adjoint operator, $\tilde V,$
such that the straight line $H_0 + \mathbb R(V-\tilde V)$ belongs to the
resonance set.
  Another result of this paper is that inside the essential spectrum there
exist plenty of transversal to the resonance set perturbations $V$ which have
order $\geq 2,$ in contrast to what happens outside the essential spectrum,

Pompeiu property if the only continuous function which integrates to zero on

respects, the Pompeiu property can be viewed as an overdetermined problem,
given its relation with the Schiffer problem. It is well-known that every
Euclidean ball fails the Pompeiu property while spherical balls have the
property for almost all radii (Ungar's Freak theorem). In the present paper we
discuss the Pompeiu property when $M$ is compact and admits an isoparametric
foliation. In particular, we identify precise conditions on the spectrum of the
Laplacian on $M$ under which the level domains of an isoparametric function
fail the Pompeiu property. Specific calculations are carried out when the

pair of commuting differential operators is algebraically dependent, (2) the
classification of maximal commutative algebras of differential operators in

of rank 1 in an algebro-geometric way. Unlike the available proofs of the
Burchnall-Chaundy theorem which use the action of one differential operator on
the kernel of the other, our extension to the fractional case uses bounds on
orders of fractional differential operators and growth of algebras, which also
presents a new and much shorter proof of the original result. The second main
theorem is achieved by developing a new tool of the spectral field of a point

spectrum of eigenvalues of finite multiplicity. The spectrum is intrinsically
linked to the geometry of the surface. In this work, we consider surfaces of
constant negative curvature with a large symmetry group. It is not possible to
calculate explicitly the eigenvalues for surfaces in this class, so we combine
group theoretic and analytical methods to derive results about the spectrum.
  In particular, we focus on the Bolza surface and the Klein quartic. These
have the highest order symmetry groups among compact Riemann surfaces of genera
2 and 3 respectively. We analyse the irreducible representations of the full
isomorphism group of the Bolza surface and prove that the multiplicity of the
first positive eigenvalue is 3, building on the work of Jenni, and identify the
irreducible representation that corresponds to this eigenspace. This proof
relies on a certain conjecture, for which we give substantial numerical
evidence and a hopeful method for proving. We go on to show that the second
distinct positive eigenvalue has multiplicity 4.","A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial fulfilment of the

isotropic as a random field on $S^3$, although the two spaces can be
identified. The ambiguity is due to the fact that the notion of isotropy on a
group and on a sphere are different, the latter being much stronger. We show
that any isotropic random field on $S^3$ is necessarily a superposition of
uncorrelated random harmonic homogeneous polynomials, such that the one of
degree $d$ is necessarily a superposition of uncorrelated random spin weighted
functions of every possible spin weight in the range
$\{-\frac{d}{2},\dots,\frac{d}{2}\}$, each of which is isotropic in the sense
of $SU(2)$. Moreover, for a random field of fixed degree, each spin weight
appears with the same magnitude, in a sense to be specified.
