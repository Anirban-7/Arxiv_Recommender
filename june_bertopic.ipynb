[{\"hoverinfo\":\"text\",\"hovertext\":[\"what is the optimal way to deform a projective hypersurface into another one in this paper we will answer this question adopting the point of view of measure theory introducing the optimal transport problem between complex algebraic projective hypersurfaces first a natural topological embedding of the space of hypersurfaces of a given degree into the space of measures on the projective space is constructed then the optimal transport problem between hypersurfaces is defined through a constrained dynamical formulation minimizing the energy of absolutely continuous curves which lie on the image of this embedding in this way an inner wasserstein distance on the projective space of homogeneous polynomials is introduced this distance is complete and geodesic geodesics corresponds to optimal deformations of one algebraic hypersurface into another one outside the discriminant this distance is induced by a smooth riemannian metric which is the real part of an explicit hermitian structure the topology induced by the inner wasserstein distance is finer than the fubini study one to prove these results we develop new techniques which combine complex and symplectic geometry with optimal transport and which we expect to be relevant on their own we discuss applications on the regularity of the zeroes of a family of multivariate polynomials and on the condition number of polynomial systems solving\",\"for linear cocycles in banach spaces the evolution of length elements in a given metric can be characterized by what we call infinitesimal growth exponents then the maximization procedure of such values provides an upper bound usually very rough for the largest uniform lyapunov exponent however for quasi compact cocycles we prove that one can always adapt the metric not necessarily coercive in such a way that the maximization procedure will produce values arbitrarily close to the largest uniform lyapunov exponent of the cocycle in the context of compound cocycles acting on exterior products of hilbert spaces this gives a variational description of uniform lyapunov exponents and allows to give a comprehensive look at the liouville trace formula which describes evolution of infinitesimal volumes and the corresponding symmetrization procedure that are widely used to obtain effective dimension estimates for global attractors in finite and infinite dimensional dynamical systems our abstract result explains known exact computations of the lyapunov dimension over global attractors with the aid of adapted metrics and motivates further investigations of the problem we use adapted metrics and the trace formula to obtain to the best of our knowledge for the first time effective dimension estimates for a general class of delay equations in particular we illustrate the approach by deriving such estimates for chaotic attractors arising in the mackey glass equations and periodically forced suarez schopf delayed oscillator as the delay value tends to infinity the estimates seem to be asymptotically sharp\",\"the gauss map of an immersion of a smooth oriented surface into takes values on the grassmanian of oriented two planes in  since this manifold has a structure of a product of two spheres this map has two components that take values on the sphere we study the singularities of the components of the gauss map and relate them to the geometric properties of the immersion moreover we prove that the singularities are generically stable finally we get some formulas of gauss bonnet type involving the cusp points of the components\",\"the aim of this note is to establish the correspondence between the twisted localized pestov identity on the unit tangent bundle of a riemannian manifold and the weitzenbock identity for twisted symmetric tensors on the manifold\",\"let and be two integers let denote the dimensional hamming graph over a element set let denote the terwilliger algebra of  let denote the standard module let denote a complex scalar we consider a unital associative algebra defined by generators and relations the generators are and  the relations are   the algebra is the case of the askey wilson algebras corresponding to the krawtchouk polynomials the algebra is isomorphic to when  we view as a module we apply the clebsch gordan rule for to decompose into a direct sum of irreducible modules\",\"we describe a systematic approach to cast the differential equation for the loop equal mass banana integral into an factorised form with the known boundary value at a specific point we obtain systematically the term of order in the expansion in the dimensional regularisation parameter for any loop  the approach is based on properties of calabi yau operators and in particular on self duality\",\"in the paper some geometric properties of the plane interception curve defined by a nonlinear ordinary differential equation are discussed its parametric representation is used to find the limits of some triangle elements associated with the curve these limits have some connections with the lemniscate constants ab and gausss constant g which were used to compare with the classical pursuit curve the analogous spherical geometry problem is solved using a spherical curve defined by the gudermannian function it is shown that the results agree with the angle preserving property of mercator and stereographic projections the mercator and stereographic projections also reveal the symmetry of this curve with respect to spherical and logarithmic spirals the geometric properties of the spherical curve are proved in two ways analytically and using a lemma about spherical angles a similar lemma for the planar case is also mentioned the paper shows symmetryasymmetry between the spherical and planar cases and the derivation of the properties of these curves as limiting cases of some plane and spherical geometry results\",\"we show that the generalized sqg equation with is locally well posed on the half plane in spaces of bounded integrable solutions that are natural for its dynamic on domains with boundaries and allow for some power growth of the solution derivative in the normal direction at the boundary we also show existence of solutions exhibiting finite time blow up in the whole local well posedness parameter regime  which is the first finite time singularity result for equations as opposed to patch models of this type moreover we prove optimality of both these results by showing ill posedness of the pde in all the above spaces when \",\" dimensional integrable quantum field theories correspond to a sparse subset of quantum field theories where the calculation of physically interesting observables can be brought to explicit closed and manageable expressions thanks to the factorisability of the s matrices which govern the scattering in these models in particular the correlation functions are expressed in terms of explicit series of multiple integrals this non perturbatively for all values of the coupling however the question of convergence of these series and thus the mathematical well definiteness of these correlators is mostly open this paper reviews the overall setting used to formulate such models and discusses the recent progress relative to solving the convergence issues in the case of the  dimensional massive integrable sinh gordon quantum field theory\",\"we study global solutions to the thin obstacle problem with at most quadratic growth at infinity we show that every ellipsoid can be realized as the contact set of such a solution on the other hand if such a solution has a compact contact set we show that it must be an ellipsoid\",\"we prove a hopf bifurcation theorem in general banach spaces which improves a classical result by crandall and rabinowitz actually our theorem does not need any compactness conditions which leads to wider applications in particular our theorem can be applied to semilinear and quasi linear partial differential equations in unbounded domains of \",\"we give a construction of generalized cluster varieties and generalized cluster scattering diagrams for reciprocal generalized cluster algebras the latter of which were defined by chekhov and shapiro these constructions are analogous to the structures given for ordinary cluster algebras in the work of gross hacking keel and kontsevich as a consequence of these constructions we are also able to construct theta functions for generalized cluster algebras again in the reciprocal case and demonstrate a number of their structural properties\",\"we equip the category of vector bundles over the vertices of a locally finite building with the structure of a module category over a category of type webs in positive characteristic this module category is a analogue of the action on vector bundles over the weight lattice we show our module categories are equivariant with respect to symmetries of the building and when a group acts simply transitively on the vertices of this recovers the fiber functors constructed by jones\",\"we consider a quantum oscillator coupled to a bath of other oscillators the total system evolves with a quasi hermitian hamiltonian associated to it is a family of hermitian systems parameterized by a unitary map  our main goal is to find the influence of on the entropy and the entanglement in the hermitian systems we calculate explicitly the reduced density matrix of the single oscillator for all hermitian systems and show that regardless of  their von neumann entropy oscillates with a common period which is twice that of the non hermitian system we show that generically the oscillator and the bath are entangled for almost all times while the amount of entanglement depends on the choice of  it is independent of when averaged over a period these results describe some universality in the physical properties of all hermitian systems associated to a given non hermitian one\",\"in this note we will provide a gradient estimate for harmonic maps from a complete noncompact riemannian manifold with compact boundary which we call kasue manifold into a simply connected complete riemannian manifold with non positive sectional curvature as a consequence we can obtain a liouville theorem we will also show the nonexistence of positive solutions to some linear elliptic equation on kasue manifold\",\"we prove that many relatively hyperbolic groups obtained by relative strict hyperbolization admit a cocompact action on a cat cubical complex under suitable assumptions on the peripheral subgroups these groups are residually finite and even virtually special we include some applications to the theory of manifolds such as the construction of new non positively curved riemannian manifolds with residually finite fundamental group and the existence of non triangulable aspherical manifolds with virtually special fundamental group\",\"in this paper we are concerned with the structure of tame symmetric algebras of period four tsp algebras for short we will mostly focus on the case when the gabriel quiver of is biserial ie there are at most two arrows ending and at most two arrows starting at each vertex but some of the results can be easily extended to the general case this serves as a basis for upcoming series of articles devoted to solve the problem of classification of all tsp algebras with biserial gabriel quiver we present a range of properties with relatively short proofs which must hold for the gabriel quiver of a tame symmetric algebra of period four amongst others we show that triangles and squares appear naturally in the gabriel quivers of such algebras such as for weighted surface algebras   \",\"we study tomonaga luttinger liquids thrown out of equilibrium by marginal deformations in the form of interaction modulations this is modeled by quenching or periodically driving the luttinger parameter or equivalently the compactification radius of the free boson conformal field theory between two different values we obtain exact analytical results for the evolution of the loschmidt echo and observables such as the particle and energy densities starting from generic initial states the quench dynamics are shown to exhibit revivals and temporal orthogonalities for the periodic drive we show stability or instability of time evolved physical quantities dependent on the drive parameters we also compare the corresponding marginally deformed thermal density matrices by non perturbatively evaluating their renyi divergence as a euclidean quench all the dynamics are shown to be crucially dependent on the ratio of the luttinger parameters which corresponds to the zamolodchikov distance in the space of marginal deformations our setup is equivalently interpreted as the dynamics of the bosonic string upon instantaneous changes of the target space radius\",\"we study the well posedness for the inhomogeneous hartree equation in   until recently its well posedness theory has been intensively studied focusing on solving the problem for the critical index with  but the case is still an open problem in this paper we develop the well posedness theory in this case especially including the energy critical case to this end we approach to the matter based on the sobolev lorentz space which can lead us to perform a finer analysis for this equation this is because it makes it possible to control the nonlinearity involving the singularity as well as the riesz potential more effectively\",\"there is a type of distance regular graph said to be polynomial in this paper we investigate a generalized polynomial property involving a graph that is not necessarily distance regular we give a detailed description of an example associated with the projective geometry \",\"we construct a faithful categorical action of the type braid group on the bounded homotopy category of finitely generated projective modules over a finite dimensional algebra which we call the type zigzag algebra this categorical action is closely related to the action of the type braid group on curves on the disc thus our exposition can be seen as a type analogue of the work of khovanov seidel in arxivmath moreover we relate our topological respectively categorical action of the type artin braid group to their topological respectively categorical action of the type artin braid group then we prove rouquiers conjecture that is conjecture  in arxivmath on the faithfulness of type braid group on soergel category following the strategy used by jensens masters thesis with the diagrammatic tools from arxiv in the final part of the thesis we produce a graded fock vector in the laurent ring for a crossingless matching using heisenberg algebra we conjecture that the span of such vectors forms a temperley lieb representation and hence a new presentation of jones polynomial can be obtained\",\"we prove that the generating functions for the colored homfly pt polynomials of rational links are specializations of the generating functions of the motivic donaldson thomas invariants of appropriate quivers that we naturally associate with these links this shows that the conjectural links quivers correspondence of kucharski reineke stovsic sulkowski as well as the lmov conjecture hold for rational links along the way we extend the links quivers correspondence to tangles and thus explore elements of a skein theory for motivic donaldson thomas invariants\",\"we provide a dual version of the geck rouquier theorem on the center of an iwahori hecke algebra which also covers the complex case for the eight complex reflection groups of rank  for which the symmetrising trace conjecture is known to be true we provide a new faithful matrix model for their hecke algebra  these models enable concrete calculations inside  for each of the eight groups we compute an explicit integral basis of the center of \",\"we consider the rationally extended harmonic oscillator potential which is isospectral to the conventional one and whose solutions are associated with the exceptional hermite polynomials and discuss its various important properties for different even codimension of  the uncertainty relations are obtained for different and it is shown that for the ground state the uncertainity increases as increases a one parameter family of exactly solvable isospectral potential corresponding to this extended harmonic oscillator potential is obtained special cases corresponding to the and  which give the pursey and the abhram moses potentials respectively are discussed the uncertainty relations for the entire isospectral family of potentials for different and

there is a constant such that with probability tending to as  a uniformly random degree riemannian covering surface of has no laplacian eigenvalues below other than those of and with the same multiplicities we also show that with probability tending to as  a random unitary bundle over of rank has no laplacian eigenvalues below \",\"unitary equivariance is a natural symmetry that occurs in many contexts in physics and mathematics optimization problems with such symmetry can often be formulated as semidefinite programs for a dimensional matrix variable that commutes with  for all  solving such problems naively can be prohibitively expensive even if is small but the local dimension is large we show that under additional symmetry assumptions this problem reduces to a linear program that can be solved in time that does not scale in  and we provide a general framework to execute this reduction under different types of symmetries the key ingredient of our method is a compact parametrization of the solution space by linear combinations of walled brauer algebra diagrams this parametrization requires the idempotents of a gelfand tsetlin basis which we obtain by adapting a general method arxiv inspired by the okounkov vershik approach to illustrate potential applications we use several examples from quantum information deciding the principal eigenvalue of a quantum state quantum majority vote asymmetric cloning and transformation of a black box unitary we also outline a possible route for extending our method to general unitary equivariant semidefinite programs\",\"given  and  let be a complete riemannian manifold with injectivity radius and with the supremum of absolute sectional curvature at most  and let be a complete immersed surface of constant mean curvature and with index at most  we will obtain geometric estimates for such an as a consequence of the hierarchy structure theorem in  the hierarchy structure theorem see theorem  below will be applied to understand global properties of  especially results related to the area and diameter of  by item e of theorem  the area of such a non compact is infinite we will improve this area result by proving the following when is connected here denotes the genus of the orientable cover of   there exists such that area  there exists independent of and also independent of such that if  then area  if

kobayashi hyperbolic domain has certain visibility properties with a focus on unbounded domains visibility in this context is reminiscent of visibility seen in negatively curved riemannian manifolds in the sense of eberlein oneill however we do not assume that the domains studied are cauchy complete with respect to the kobayashi distance as this is hard to establish for domains in   we study the various ways in which this property controls the boundary behavior of holomorphic maps among these results is a caratheodory type extension theorem for biholomorphisms between planar domains notably between infinitely connected domains we also explore connections between our visibility property and gromov hyperbolicity of the kobayashi distance\",\"reduced cohomology motivates to look at harmonic functions which satisfy certain gradient conditions if is a direct product of two infinite groups or a fc central by cyclic group then there are no harmonic functions with gradient in on its cayley graphs from this it follows that a metabelian group has no harmonic functions with gradient in  furthermore under a radial isoperimetric condition groups whose isoperimetric profile is bounded by power of logarithms also have no harmonic functions with gradient in \",\"by the supersymmetrization of a simple algebraic technique proposed in we obtain the complete classification of all basic nonisomorphic quantum deformations for the orthosymplectic lie superalgebra and its pseudoreal and real forms in terms of the classical matrices in particular we prove that pseudoreal compact form has only one quantum deformation standart analog and the  lorentz supersymmetry which is the non compact real form of  has four different hopf algebraic quantum deformations two standard analogs and two jordanian and super jordanian twist deformations all basic hopf algebraic quantum deformations are presented in the explicit form\",\"we define in two equivalent ways the notion of a rigid stratum of a reductive group this generalizes the notion of rigid unipotent class\",\"the notions of coherence and superposition are conceptually the same however an important distinction exists between their resource theoretic formulations namely while basis states are orthogonal in the resource theory of coherence they are not necessarily orthogonal in the resource theory of superposition owing to the nonorthogonality the manipulation and characterization of superposition states require significant efforts here we demonstrate that the lowdin symmetric orthogonalization lso method offers a useful means for characterizing pure superposition states the principal property of lso is that the structure and symmetry of the original nonorthogonal basis states are preserved to the greatest extent possible which prompts us to study the role of lso in identifying the hierarchical relations of resource states notably we reveal that the maximally coherent states turn into the states with maximal superposition with the help of lso in other words they are equivalent under the action of symmetric orthogonalization our results facilitate further connections between coherence and superposition where lso is the main tool\",\"local foliations of area constrained willmore surfaces on a dimensional riemannian manifold were constructed by lamm metzger and schulze and ikoma machiodi and mondino the leaves of these foliations are in particular critical surfaces of the hawking energy in case they are contained in a totally geodesic spacelike hypersurface we generalize these foliations to the general case of a non totally geodesic spacelike hypersurface constructing a unique local foliation of area constrained critical surfaces of the hawking energy a discrepancy when evaluating the so called small sphere limit of the hawking energy was found by friedrich he studied concentrations of area constrained critical surfaces of the hawking energy and obtained a result that apparently differs from the well established small sphere limit of the hawking energy of horowitz and schmidt this small sphere limit in principle must be satisfied by any quasi local energy we independently confirm the discrepancy and explain the reasons for it to happen we also prove that these surfaces are suitable to evaluate the hawking energy in the sense of lamm metzger and schulze and we find an indication that these surfaces may induce an excess in the energy measured\",\"recently m ludewig and g c thiang introduced a notion of a uniformly localized wannier basis with localization centers in an arbitrary uniformly discrete subset in a complete riemannian manifold  they show that under certain geometric conditions on  the class of the orthogonal projection onto the span of such a wannier basis in the theory of the roe algebra is trivial in this short note we clarify the geometric conditions on  which guarantee triviality of the theory class of any wannier projection we show that this property is equivalent to triviality of the unit of the uniform roe algebra of in the theory of its roe algebra and provide a geometric criterion for that as a consequence we prove triviality of the theory class of any wannier projection on a connected proper measure space of bounded geometry with a uniformly discrete set of localization centers coarsely equivalent to \",\"we review recent results on the study of the isoperimetric problem on riemannian manifolds with ricci lower bounds we focus on the validity of sharp second order differential inequalities satisfied by the isoperimetric profile of possibly noncompact riemannian manifolds with ricci lower bounds we give a self contained overview of the methods employed for the proof of such result which exploit modern tools and ideas from nonsmooth geometry the latter methods are needed for achieving the result even in the smooth setting next we show applications of the differential inequalities of the isoperimetric profile providing simplified proofs of the sharp and rigid isoperimetric inequality on manifolds with nonnegative ricci and euclidean volume growth existence of isoperimetric sets for large volumes on manifolds with nonnegative ricci and euclidean volume growth the classical levy gromov isoperimetric inequality on the way we discuss relations of these results and methods with the existing literature pointing out several open problems\",\"we study universal solutions to reflection equations with a spectral parameter so called k operators within a general framework of universal k matrices an extended version of the approach introduced by appel vlaar here the input data is a quasi triangular hopf algebra  its comodule algebra and a pair of consistent twists in our setting the universal k matrix is an element of satisfying certain axioms and we mostly consider the case is the quantum loop algebra for  and is the alternating central extension of the onsager algebra considering tensor products of evaluation representations of in non semisimple cases the new set of axioms allows us to introduce and study fused k operators of spin  in particular to prove that for all they satisfy the spectral parameter dependent reflection equation we provide their explicit expression in terms of elements of the algebra for small values of spin  the precise relation between the fused k operators of spin and evaluations of a universal k matrix for is conjectured based on supporting evidences independently we study k operator solutions of the twisted intertwining relations associated with the comodule algebra  and expand them in the poincare birkhoff witt basis with a reasonably general ansatz we found a unique solution for first few values of which agrees with the fused k operators as expected we conjecture that in general such solutions are uniquely determined and match with the expressions of the fused k operators\",\"over a field of characteristic zero we show that the forgetful functor from the homotopy category of commutative dg algebras to the homotopy category of dg associative algebras is faithful in fact the induced map of derived mapping spaces gives an injection on all homotopy groups at any basepoint we prove similar results both for unital and non unital algebras and also koszul dually for the universal enveloping algebra functor from dg lie algebras to dg associative algebras an important ingredient is a natural model for these derived mapping spaces as maurer cartan spaces of complete filtered dg lie algebras or curved lie algebras in the unital case\",\"we present a new look at description of real finite dimensional lie algebras the basic element turns out to be a pair consisting of a linear mapping and its eigenvector  this pair allows to build a lie bracket on a dual space to a linear space  this algebra is solvable in particular when is nilpotent the lie algebra is also nilpotent we show that these solvable algebras are the basic bricks of the construction of all other lie algebras which allows having a collection of pairs   to construct any lie algebra using relations between the lie algebra the lie poisson structure and the nambu bracket we show that the algebra invariants casimir functions are solutions of an equation which has a geometric sense several examples illustrate the importance of these constructions\",\"in this paper we investigate topological modes of different physical systems defined on arbitrary two dimensional curved surfaces we consider the shallow water equations inhomogeneous maxwells equations jackiw rebbi model and show how the topological protection mechanism responses to the presence of curvature in different situations we show the existence of a line gap in the considered models and study the condition on the curve which can host topological modes\",\"in the kdv context we put forward a continuous version of the binary darboux transformation aka the double commutation method our approach is based on the riemann hilbert problem and yields a new explicit formula for perturbation of the negative spectrum of a wide class of step type potentials without changing the rest of the scattering data this extends the previously known formulas for insertingremoving finitely many bound states to arbitrary sets of negative spectrum of arbitrary nature in the kdv context our method offers same benefits as the classical binary darboux transformation does\",\"we prove the rigidity of rectifiable boundaries with constant distributional mean curvature in the brendle class of warped product manifolds which includes important models in general relativity like the desitter schwarzschild and reissner nordstrom manifolds as a corollary we characterize limits of rectifiable boundaries whose mean curvatures converge as distributions to a constant the latter result is new and requires the full strength of distributional cmc rigidity even when one considers smooth boundaries whose mean curvature oscillations vanish in arbitrarily strong norms\",\"the problem of characterizing gkls generators and cp maps with an invariant appeared in different guises in the literature we prove two unifying results which hold even for weakly closed  algebras first we show how to construct a normal form for invariant gkls generators if a normal form for invariant cp maps is known rendering the two problems essentially equivalent second we provide a normal form for invariant cp maps if is atomic which includes the finite dimensional case as an application we reproduce several results from the literature as direct consequences of our characterizations and thereby point out connections between different fields\",\"we consider surfaces embedded in a d contact sub riemannian manifold and the problem of the finiteness of the induced distance ie the infimum of the length of horizontal curves that belong to the surface recently it has been proved that for a surface having the topology of a sphere embedded in a tight co orientable structure the distance is always finite in this paper we study closed surfaces of genus larger than  proving that such surfaces can be embedded in such a way that the induced distance is finite or infinite we then study the structural stability of the finitenessnot finiteness of the distance\",\"the

polynomially controlled singular damping on the torus we also prove that for normally damping on compact manifolds the schrodinger observability gives dependent polynomial decay and finite time extinction cannot occur we show that polynomially controlled singular damping on the circle gives exponential decay\",\"this paper aims to study isometries of the wasserstein space over carnot groups endowed with horizontally strictly convex norms well known examples of horizontally strictly convex norms on carnot groups are the heisenberg group endowed with the heisenberg koranyi norm or with the naor lee norm and type iwasawa groups endowed with a koranyi type norm we prove that on a general carnot group there always exists a horizontally strictly convex norm the main result of the paper says

impedance boundary conditions we achieve this by accommodating for the influence of heat with the inclusion of a new equation and additional boundary terms we prove the evolutionary well posedness of a known thermo piezo electromagnetic system under these boundary conditions evolutionary well posedness here means unique solvability as well as continuous and causal dependence on given data\",\"we summarize and extend some of the results obtained recently for the microscopic and macroscopic behavior of a pinned harmonic chain with random velocity flips at poissonian times acted on by a periodic force at one end and in contact with a heat bath at the other end here we consider the case where the system is in contact with two heat baths at different temperatures and a periodic force is applied at any position this leads in the hydrodynamic limit to a heat equation for the temperature profile with a discontinuous slope at the position where the force acts higher dimensional systems unpinned cases and anharmonic interactions are also considered\",\"in order to compare and interpolate signals we investigate a riemannian geometry on the space of signals the metric allows discontinuous signals and measures both horizontal thus providing many benefits of the wasserstein metric and vertical deformations moreover it allows for signed signals which overcomes the main deficiency of optimal transportation based metrics in signal processing we characterize the metric properties of the space of signals and establish the regularity and stability of geodesics furthermore we introduce an efficient numerical scheme to compute the geodesics and present several experiments which highlight the nature of the metric\",\"a case study of the non equilibrium dynamics of open quantum systems in the markovian approximation is presented for two dynamical models based on a single harmonic oscillator in an external field specified through distinct forms of ohmic damping their quantum langevin equations are derived from an identical set of physical criteria namely the canonical commutator between position and momentum the kubo formula the virial theorem and the quantum equilibrium variance the associated lindblad equations are derived but only one of them is completely positive transforming those into fokker planck equations for the wigner functions both models are shown to evolve towards the same gibbs state for a vanishing external field the phenomenological differences between the models are illustrated through their quantum relaxations and through the phase diagrammes derived from their re interpretation as mean field approximations of an interacting many body system\",\"differential calculus on euclidean spaces has many generalisations in particular on a set  a

of an annulus with conformal boundary conditions in the presence of extended symmetries such as kac moody type current algebrae symmetry resolution is possible only if the boundary conditions on the annulus preserve part of the symmetry group ie if the factorization map associated with the spatial bipartition is compatible with the symmetry in question the partition function of the boundary cft bcft is then decomposed in terms of the characters of the irreducible representations of the symmetry group preserved by the boundary conditions we demonstrate that this decomposition already provides

quasiperiodic recurrences in the weakly nonlinear fput system in more detail we aim to reconstruct the quasiperiodic behaviour observed in the original paper from the canonical transformation used to remove the three wave interactions which is necessary before applying the wave turbulence formalism we expect the construction to match the observed quasiperiodicity if we are in the weakly nonlinear regime surprisingly in our work we show that this is not always the case and in particular the recurrences observed in the original paper cannot be constructed by our method we attribute this disagreement to the presence of small denominators in the canonical transformation used to remove the three wave interactions before arriving at the starting point of wave turbulence we also show that these small denominators are present even in the weakly nonlinear regime and they become more significant as the system size is increased we also discuss our results in the context of the problem of

that we can always find a connected graph such that in short a incompressible graph whose length satisfies the following curvature free inequality  this generalizes a previous inequality proved by gromov for closed riemannian surfaces with negative euler characteristic as a consequence we obtain that the volume entropy of such complexes with unit area is always bounded away from zero\",\"in this note we show that the metaplectic theta correspondence is compatible with the tempered condition by directly estimating the matrix coefficients without using the classification theorem\",\"we study the semilinear equation on a cartan hadamard manifold of dimension  and we prove the existence of a nontrivial solution under suitable assumptions on the potential function  in particular the decay of at infinity is allowed with some restrictions related to the geometry of  we generalize some results proved in by alves emphet al\",\"we prove that for an embedded minimal surface in  the first eigenvalue of the laplacian operator satisfies  where is a constant depending only on the genus of  this improves previous result of choi wang\",\"we construct the measure on an arbitrary dimensional compact riemannian manifold without boundary as an invariant probability measure of a singular stochastic partial differential equation proving the non triviality and the local covariance under riemannian isometries of that measure gives for the first time a non perturbative non topological interacting euclidean quantum field theory on curved spaces in dimension  this answers a longstanding open problem of constructive quantum field theory on curved backgrounds to control analytically several feynman diagrams appearing in the construction of a number of random fields we introduce a novel approach of renormalization using microlocal and harmonic analysis this allows to obtain a renormalized equation which involves some universal constants independent of the manifold in a companion paper we develop in a self contained way all the tools from paradifferential and microlocal analysis that we use to build in our manifold setting a number of analytic and probabilistic objects\",\"this chapter provides a non technical overview and motivation for the recent interactions between algebraic quantum field theory aqft and rather abstract mathematical disciplines such as operads model categories and higher categories\",\"a fundamental theorem of p deligne  states that a pre tannakian category over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero admits a fiber functor to the category of supervector spaces ie is the representation category of an affine proalgebraic supergroup if and only if it has moderate growth ie the lengths of tensor powers of an object grow at most exponentially in this paper we prove a characteristic p version of this theorem namely we show that a pre tannakian category over an algebraically closed field of characteristic p admits a fiber functor into the verlinde category verp ie is the representation category of an affine group scheme in verp if and only if it has moderate growth and is frobenius exact this implies that frobenius exact pre tannakian categories of moderate growth admit a well behaved notion of frobenius perron dimension it follows that any semisimple pre tannakian category of moderate growth has a fiber functor to verp so in particular delignes theorem holds on the nose for semisimple pre tannakian categories in characteristics  this settles a conjecture of the third author from  in particular this result applies to semisimplifications of categories of modular representations of finite groups or more generally affine group schemes which gives new applications to classical modular representation theory for example it allows us to characterize for a modular representation v the possible growth rates of the number of indecomposable summands in votimes n of dimension prime to p\",\"we define a notion of higher order renormalization group equation and investigate when a sequence of trees satisfies such an equation in the strongest sense the sequence of trees satisfies a th order renormalization group equation when applying any choice of feynman rules results in a green function satisfying a th order renormalization group equation and we characterize all such sequences of trees we also make some comments on sequences of trees which require special choices of feynman rules in order to satisfy a higher order renormalization group equation\",\"in this work we establish a freidlin wentzell type large deviation principle for stochastic nonlinear schrodinger equation with either focusing or defocusing nonlinearity driven by nonlinear multiplicative levy noise in the marcus canonical form one essential ingredient of the proof is a variant of the well known large deviation criteria of budhiraja chen dupuis and maroulas for functions of poisson random measures which is proposed by the third named author of this paper and his collaborators potential anal  obtaining the large deviation principle result is challenging in the current setting due to the presence of the nonlinear term the lack of regularization effect of the schrodinger operator and the absence of compactness of embeddings to overcome these difficulties we employ a regularization procedure based on yosida approximations to handle the lack of regularization effect of the schrodinger operator additionally to tackle the absence of compact embeddings we adopt several techniques including time discretization cut off arguments and relative entropy estimates of sequences of probability measures this also distinguishes the current work from most of previous studies on large deviation principle of stochastic partial differential equations with levy noise which heavily rely on the compactness conditions\",\"in an earlier paper we described bordered algebras for knot floer homology in this paper we introduce a differential graded algebra the pong algebra and compute the a infinity structure on its homology\",\"in analogy to the concept of a non metric dual connection which is essential in defining statistical manifolds we develop that of a torsion dual connection consequently we illustrate the geometrical meaning of such a torsion dual connection and show how the use of both connections preserves the cracking of parallelograms in spaces equipped with a connection and its torsion dual the coefficients of such a torsion dual connection are essentially computed by demanding a vanishing mutual torsion among the two connections for this manifold we then prove two basic theorems in particular if both connections are metric compatible we show that there exists a specific form measuring how the connection and its torsion dual deviate away from the levi civita one furthermore we prove that for these torsion dual manifolds flatness of one connection does not necessary impose flatness on the other but rather that the curvature tensor of the latter is given by a specific divergence finally we give a self consistent definition of the mutual curvature tensor of two connections and subsequently define the notion of a curvature dual connection\",\"we prove that the generating functions for the one rowcolumn colored homfly pt invariants of arborescent links are specializations of the generating functions of the motivic donaldson thomas invariants of appropriate quivers that we naturally associate with these links our approach extends the previously established tangles quivers correspondence for rational tangles to algebraic tangles by developing gluing formulas for homfly pt skein generating functions under conways tangle addition as a consequence we prove the conjectural links quivers correspondence of kucharski reineke stovsic sulkowski for all arborescent links\",\"we prove a lower bound for the entropy dissipation of the landau equation with coulomb potentials by a weighted lebesgue norm  in particular we enhance the weight exponent from  which was established by desvillettes to  moreover we prove that the weighted lebesgue norm is optimal for both exponents\",\"a classical result owing to mancini and sandeep ann sc norm super pisa cl sci  asserts that all positive solutions of the poincare sobolev equation on the hyperbolic space are unique up to hyperbolic isometries where and we prove under certain bounds on the inequality holds whenever and hence forcing the dimensional restriction where denotes the distance of from the manifold of sums of hyperbolic bubbles moreover it fails for any and this strengthens the phenomenon observed in the euclidean case that the linear quantitative stability estimate depends only on whether the exponent is or  in the critical case our dimensional constraint coincides with the seminal result of figalli and glaudo arch ration mech anal  but we notice a striking dependence on the exponent in the subcritical regime as well which is not present in the flat case our technique is an amalgamation of figalli and glaudos method and builds upon a series of new and novel estimates on the interaction of hyperbolic bubbles and their derivatives and improved eigenfunction integrability estimates since the conformal group coincides with the isometry group of the hyperbolic space we perceive a remarkable distinction in arguments and techniques to achieve our main results compared to that of the euclidean case\",\"a triangulated category with a canonical botts isomorphism is called a cyclic category in this paper we give a new notion of stability conditions on a linear krull schmidt cyclic category given such a stability condition  we can assign a maslov index to each basic loop in such a category if all maslov indexes vanish we get as the lifts of respectively such that is a graded triangulated category and is a bridgeland stability condition on  moreover we showed that there is an isomorphism where denotes the equivalence classes of stability conditions which are deformation equivalent to  and denotes the space of bridgeland stability conditions on  we provide examples of stability conditions on a simple cyclic category we also discuss some interesting phenomena in these examples such as the chirality symmetry breaking phenomenon and nontrivial monodromy the chirality symmetry breaking phenomenon involves stability conditions which can not be lifted to bridgeland stability conditions\",\"given a sample of an abstract manifold immersed in some euclidean space we describe a way to recover the singular homology of the original manifold it consists in estimating its tangent bundle seen as subset of another euclidean space in a measure theoretic point of view and in applying measure based filtrations for persistent homology the construction we propose is consistent and stable and does not involve the knowledge of the dimension of the manifold in order to obtain quantitative results we introduce the normal reach which is a notion of reach suitable for an immersed manifold\",\"homomorphic expansions are combinatorial invariants of knotted objects which are universal in the sense that all finite type vassiliev invariants factor through them homomorphic expansions are also important as bridging objects between low dimensional topology and quantum algebra for example homomorphic expansions of parenthesised braids are in one to one correspondence with drinfeld associators bar natan  and homomorphic expansions of foams are in one to one correspondence with solutions to the kashiwara vergne kv equations bar natan and the first author  the sets of drinfeld associators and kv solutions are both bi torsors with actions by the pro unipotent grothendieck teichmuller and kashiwara vergne groups respectively the above correspondences are in fact maps of bi torsors bar natan  and the first and third authors with halacheva  there is a deep relationship between drinfeld associators and kv equations discovered by alekseev enriquez and torossian in the s including an explicit formula constructing kv solutions in terms of associators and an injective map  this paper is a topologicaldiagrammatic study of the image of the grothendieck teichmuller groups in the kashiwara vergne symmetry groups using the fact that both parenthesised braids and foams admit respective finite presentations as an operad and as a tensor category circuit algebra or prop\",\"this paper deals with the exponential stability of systems made of a hyperbolic pde coupled with an ode with different time scales the dynamics of the pde being much faster than that of the ode such a difference of time scales is modeled though a small parameter multiplying the time derivative in the pde and our stability analysis relies on the singular perturbation method more precisely we define two subsystems a reduced order system representing the dynamics of the full system in the limit  and a boundary layer system which represents the dynamics of the pde in the fast time scale our main result shows that if both the reduced order and the boundary layer systems are exponentially stable then the full system is also exponentially stable for small enough and our strategy is based on a spectral analysis of the systems under consideration our main result improves a previous result in the literature which was proved using a lyapunov approach and required a stronger assumption on the boundary layer system to obtain the same conclusion\",\"three manifold invariants  hat also known as homological blocks are series with integer coefficients explicit series form for is known for group supergroup and ortho symplectic supergroup  we focus on for group and orthosymplectic supergroup in this paper particularly the change of variable relating link invariants to the  link invariants plays a crucial role in explicitly writing the series\",\"quantum simulation is a promising application of future quantum computers product formulas or trotterization are the oldest and still remain an appealing method to simulate quantum systems for an accurate product formula approximation the state of the art gate complexity depends on the number of terms in the hamiltonian and a local energy estimate in this work we give evidence that product formulas in practice may work much better than expected we prove that the trotter error exhibits a qualitatively better scaling for the vast majority of input states while the existing estimate is for the worst states for general local hamiltonians and higher order product formulas we obtain gate count estimates for input states drawn from any orthogonal basis the gate complexity significantly improves over the worst case for systems with large connectivity our typical case results generalize to hamiltonians with fermionic terms with input states drawn from a fixed particle number subspace and with gaussian coefficients eg the syk models technically we employ a family of simple but versatile inequalities from non commutative martingales called  which leads to  namely norm estimates for local operators this delivers concentration bounds via markovs inequality for optimality we give analytic and numerical examples that simultaneously match our typical case estimates and the existing worst case estimates therefore our improvement is due to asking a qualitatively different question and our results open doors to the study of quantum algorithms in the average case\",\"a regularity result for free discontinuity energies defined on the space of special functions of bounded variation with variable exponent is proved under the assumption of a log holder continuity for the variable exponent  our analysis expand on the regularity theory for minimizers of a class of free discontinuity problems in the nonstandard growth case this may be seen as a follow up of the paper fusco mingione and trombetti  dealing with a constant exponent\",\"we introduce the yang baxter hochschild ybh cohomology theory for associative algebras with a yang baxter yb operator satisfying certain compatibility conditions called braided algebras that represent some of the combinatorial moves for spatial trivalent graphs we provide families of examples of braided algebras that this cohomology theory applies to including hopf algebras tensorized multiple conjugation quandles and braided frobenius algebras we propose a complex based on deformation theory for which we show that the second ybh cohomology group classifies the infinitesimal deformations and the third ybh cohomology group contains the obstructions to quadratic deformations relations to hopf algebra cohomology are also discussed\",\"we prove that the affine closure of the cotangent bundle of the basic affine space of a reductive group has conical symplectic singularities which confirms a conjecture of ginzburg and kazhdan we also show that this variety is factorial and has terminal singularities\",\"we classify braided generalized near group fusion categories whose global dimension is not an integer there are exactly two up to grothendieck equivalence and taking products with braided pointed fusion categories\",\"in this paper we address the decay of solutions to the four dimen sional energy critical nonlinear heat equation in the critical space  recently it was proven that the norm of solutions goes to zero when time goes to infinity but no decay rates were established by means of the fourier splitting method and using properties arising from the scale invariance we obtain an algebraic upper bound for the decay rate of solutions\",\"we construct a family of oriented extended topological field theories using the aksz construction in derived algebraic geometry which can be viewed as an algebraic and topological version of the classical aksz field theories that occur in physics these have as their targets higher categories of symplectic derived stacks with higher morphisms given by iterated lagrangian correspondences we define these as well as analogous higher categories of oriented derived stacks and iterated oriented cospans and prove that all objects are fully dualizable then we set up a functorial version of the aksz construction first implemented in this context by pantev toen vaquie vezzosi and show that it induces a family of symmetric monoidal functors from oriented stacks to symplectic stacks finally we construct forgetful functors from the unoriented bordism category to cospans of spaces and from the oriented bordism category to cospans of spaces equipped with an orientation the latter combines with the aksz functors by viewing spaces as constant stacks giving the desired field theories\",\"we consider an algebra of even order square tensors and introduce a stretching map which allows us to represent tensors as matrices the stretching map could be understood as a generalized matricization it conserves algebraic properties of the tensors in the same time we dont necessarily assume injectivity of the stretching map dropping the injectivity condition allows us to construct examples of stretching maps with additional symmetry properties furthermore the noninjectivity leads to the averaging of the tensor and possibly could be used to compress the data\",\"we study the mean curvature flow of smooth dimensional compact submanifolds with quadratic pinching in a riemannian manifold  our main focus is on the case of high codimension  we establish a codimension estimate that shows in regions of high curvature the submanifold becomes approximately codimension one in a quantifiable way this estimate enables us to prove at a singular time of the flow there exists a rescaling that converges to a smooth codimension one limiting flow in euclidean space under a cylindrical type pinching this limiting flow is weakly convex and moves by translation our approach relies on the preservation of the quadratic pinching condition along the flow and a gradient estimate that controls the mean curvature in regions of high curvature these estimates allow us to analyse the behaviour of the flow near singularities and establish the existence of the limiting flow\",\"we show that the parameterized family of the generalized constantin lax majda model also known as the okamoto sakajo wensch model admits exact self similar finite time blowup solutions with interiorly smooth profiles for all  depending on the value of  these self similar profiles are either smooth on the whole real line or compactly supported and smooth in the interior of their closed supports the existence of these profiles is proved in a consistent way by considering the fixed point problem of an dependent nonlinear map based on which detailed characterizations of their regularity monotonicity and far field decay rates are established our work unifies existing results for some discrete values of and also explains previous numerical observations for a wide range of \",\"in this paper we study the overdetermined problem for the laplacian equation on complete noncompact riemannian manifolds with nonnegative ricci curvature we prove that the regularity results of weak solutions of the laplacian equation and obtain some integral identities as their applications we give the proof of the laplacian overdetermined problem and obtain some well known results such as the heintze karcher inequality and the soap bubble theorem\",\"these notes arose from three lectures on fusion system i gave at the university of valencia in february  we first consider fusion phenomena in classical group theory then we develop the abstract theory of fusion systems finally applications to representation theory are given we will not consider applications in topology\",\"in this work we construct global unique solutions of the dissipative surface quasi geostrophic equation  sqg that lose regularity instantly when there is super critical fractional diffusion\",\"in the paper we discuss apollonius problem on the number of normals of an ellipse passing through a given point by following the footsteps of apollonius it is shown that the number is dependent on the position of the given point with respect to a certain astroida the special case when the point is on the ellipse is studied using the intersection points of the astroida and the ellipse the problem is then generalized for dimensional space namely for ellipsoids the number in this case is shown to be dependent on the position of the given point with respect to caustics of the ellipsoid if the given point is on the ellipsoid then the number of normals is dependent on position of the point with respect to the intersections of the ellipsoid with its caustics\",\"the deligne simpson problem is an existence problem for connections with specified local behavior almost all previous work on this problem has restricted attention to connections with regular or unramified singularities recently the authors together with kulkarni and matherne formulated a version of the deligne simpson problem where certain ramified singular points are allowed and solved it for the case of coxeter connections ie connections on the riemann sphere with a maximally ramified singularity at zero and possibly an additional regular singular point at infinity a certain matrix completion problem which we call the upper nilpotent completion problem plays a key role in our solution this problem was solved by krupnik and leibman but their work does not provide a practical way of constructing explicit matrix completions accordingly our previous work does not give explicit coxeter connections with specified singularities in this paper we provide a numerically stable and highly efficient algorithm for producing upper nilpotent completions of certain matrices that arise in the theory of coxeter connections moreover we show how the matrices generated by this algorithm can be used to provide explicit constructions of coxeter connections with arbitrary unipotent monodromy in each case that such a connection exists\",\"we present a model reduction approach that extends the original empirical interpolation method to enable accurate and efficient reduced basis approximation of parametrized nonlinear partial differential equations pdes in the presence of nonlinearity the galerkin reduced basis approximation remains computationally expensive due to the high complexity of evaluating the nonlinear terms which depends on the dimension of the truth approximation the empirical interpolation method eim was proposed as a nonlinear model reduction technique to render the complexity of evaluating the nonlinear terms independent of the dimension of the truth approximation the main idea is to replace any nonlinear term with a reduced basis expansion expressed as a linear combination of pre computed basis functions and parameter dependent coefficients the coefficients are determined efficiently by an inexpensive and stable interpolation procedure in order to improve the approximation accuracy we propose a first order empirical interpolation method foeim that employs both the nonlinear function and its partial derivatives at selected parameter points to construct the reduced basis expansion of the nonlinear term our approach is applied to nonlinear elliptic pdes and compared to the galerkin reduced basis approximation and the eim numerical results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the three reduced basis approaches\",\"we prove that given a finite set in a bordered riemann surface  there is a continuous map  such that is a complete holomorphic immersion embedding if  which is meromorphic on and has effective poles at all points in  and is a topological embedding in particular consists of the union of finitely many pairwise disjoint jordan curves which we ensure to be of hausdorff dimension one we establish a more general result including uniform approximation and interpolation\",\"we investigate the spectrum of the spin dirac operator on families of hyperbolic surfaces where a set of disjoint simple geodesics shrink to  under the hypothesis that the spin structure is non trivial along each pinched geodesic the main tool is a trace formula for the dirac operator on finite area hyperbolic surfaces we derive a version of hubers theorem and a non standard small time heat trace asymptotic expansion for hyperbolic surfaces with cusps as a corollary we find a simultaneous weyl law for the eigenvalues of the dirac operator which is emphuniform in the degenerating parameter the main result is the convergence of the selberg zeta function associated to the dirac operator on such families of hyperbolic surfaces a central role is played by a valued class function determined by the spin structure\",\"this paper presents a new provably convergent algorithm for computing the flag mean and flag median of a set of points on a flag manifold under the chordal metric the flag manifold is a mathematical space consisting of flags which are sequences of nested subspaces of a vector space that increase in dimension the flag manifold is a superset of a wide range of known matrix groups including stiefel and grassmanians making it a general object that is useful in a wide variety computer vision problems to tackle the challenge of computing first order flag statistics we first transform the problem into one that involves auxiliary variables constrained to the stiefel manifold the stiefel manifold is a space of orthogonal frames and leveraging the numerical stability and efficiency of stiefel manifold optimization enables us to compute the flag mean effectively through a series of experiments we show the competence of our method in grassmann and rotation averaging as well as principal component analysis\",\"the goal of this work is to obtain optimal rates for the convergence problem in mean field control our analysis covers cases where the solutions to the limiting problem may not be unique nor stable equivalently the value function of the limiting problem might not be differentiable on the entire space our main result is then to derive sharp rates of convergence in two distinct regimes when the data is sufficiently regular we obtain rates proportional to  with being the number of particles when the data is merely lipschitz and semi concave with respect to the first wasserstein distance we obtain rates proportional to  noticeably the exponent is close to  which is the optimal rate of convergence for uncontrolled particle systems driven by data with a similar regularity the key argument in our approach consists in mollifying the value function of the limiting problem in order to produce functions that are almost classical sub solutions to the limiting hamilton jacobi equation which is a pde set on the space of probability measures these sub solutions can be projected onto finite dimensional spaces and then compared with the value functions associated with the particle systems in the end this comparison is used to prove the most demanding bound in the estimates the key challenge therein is thus to exhibit an appropriate form of mollification we do so by employing sup convolution within a convenient functional hilbert space to make the whole easier we limit ourselves to the periodic setting we also provide some examples to show that our results are sharp up to some extent\",\"let a complex algebraic reductive group act on a complex algebraic manifold  for a invariant subvariety of the nilpotent cone we define a notion of symplectic complexity of  this notion generalizes the notion of complexity defined in vin we prove several properties of this notion and relate it to the notion of complexity defined in ag motivated by its relation with representation theory\",\"we give a chevalley formula for an arbitrary weight for the torus equivariant group of semi infinite flag manifolds which is expressed in terms of the quantum alcove model as an application we prove the chevalley formula for an anti dominant fundamental weight for the small torus equivariant quantum theory of an ordinary flag manifold  this has been a longstanding conjecture about the multiplicative structure of  in type  we prove that the so called quantum grothendieck polynomials indeed represent opposite schubert classes in the non equivariant quantum theory  we also obtain very explicit information about the coefficients in the respective chevalley formula\",\"let be a group acting on a finite dimensional vector space then acts linearly on the space of complex valued polynomial functions on the vector space a very difficult problem is to parametrize the orbits in  at least for the closed orbits one may hope to use invariant polynomial functions on to separate orbits which sometimes is impossible for classical groups however more can be said our main result is a concrete algorithm for writing down the invariant functions on  the invariant algebra in this case unlike the typical case in classical invariant theory is not noetherian and therefore we impose a bigradation which allows a combinatorial approach specifically our algorithm gives a graded correspondence between the set of graphs of a certain type depending on the classical group  and a basis for the invariant algebra we provide mathematica code to implement our algorithm we also express the bigraded hilbert series of the invariant algebra in terms of branching multiplicities from the general linear group to the symmetric group\",\"let be a connected complex reductive lie group and a spherical homogenous space let be a polarized variety which is a spherical embedding of  in this paper we classify equivariant normal test configurations of via combinatory data in particular we classify the special ones and prove a finiteness theorem of central fibres of equivariant special test configurations also as an application we study the semistable degeneration problem of a fano spherical variety\",\"given an rcd space  one can use its heat kernel to map it into the space by a locally lipschitz map  the space is said to be an isometrically heat kernel immersing space if each is an isometric immersion after a normalization a main result states that any compact isometrically heat kernel immersing rcd space is isometric to an unweighted closed smooth riemannian manifold this is justified by a more general result if a compact non collapsed rcd space has an isometrically immersing eigenmap then the space is isometric to an unweighted closed riemannian manifold which greatly improves a regularity result in by honda as an application of these results we give a compactness theorem for a certain class of riemannian manifolds with a curvature dimension diameter bound and an isometrically immersing eigenmap\",\"we initiate the treatment of kms states on uniform roe algebras for a class of naturally occurring flows on these algebras we show that kms states on always factor through the diagonal operators  we show the study of those states splits into understanding their strongly continuous kms states and the kms states which vanish on the ideal of compact operators we show strongly continuous states are always unique when they exist and we give explicit formulas for them we link the study of kms states which vanish on the compacts to the higson corona of and provide lower bounds for the cardinality of the set of extreme kms states lastly we apply our theory to the branching tree\",\"we study the deformation theory of einstein yang mills fields over conformally compact asymptotically locally hyperbolic manifolds we prove that if an einstein yang mills field is trivial which means that is poincare einstein and is a flat connection on a principal bundle over the underlying manifold and non degenerate in the appropriate sense then any sufficiently small perturbation of its boundary data at infinity may be realized as the boundary data of some einstein yang mills field this result is obtained as an application of the calculus of mazzeo and melrose and may be viewed as a natural extension of previous results by graham lee lee and usula\",\"although lattice yang mills theory on finite subgraphs of is easy to rigorously define the construction of a satisfactory continuum theory on is a major open problem when  such a theory should in some sense assign a wilson loop expectation to each suitable finite collection of loops in  one classical approach is to try to represent this expectation as a sum over surfaces with boundary  there are some formalheuristic ways to make sense of this notion but they typically yield an ill defined difference of infinities in this paper we show how to make sense of yang mills integrals as surface sums for  where the continuum theory is more accessible applications include several new explicit calculations a new combinatorial interpretation of the master field and a new probabilistic proof of the makeenko migdal equation\",\"of concern are lump solutions for the fractional kadomtsev petviashvili fkp equation as in the classical kadomtsev petviashvili equation the fkp equation comes in two versions fkp i strong surface tension case and fkp ii weak surface tension case we prove the existence of nontrivial lump solutions for the fkp i equation in the energy subcritical case by means of variational methods it is already known that there exist neither nontrivial lump solutions belonging to the energy space for the fkp ii equation nor for the fkp i when  furthermore we show that for any lump solutions for the fkp i equation are smooth and decay quadratically at infinity numerical experiments are performed for the existence of lump solutions and their decay moreover numerically we observe cross sectional symmetry of lump solutions for the fkp i equation\",\"we perform a complete spectral analysis of the linearized shakhov model involving two relaxation times and  our results are based on spectral functions derived from the theory of finite rank perturbations which allows us to infer the existence of a critical wave number limiting the number of discrete eigenvalues above the essential spectrum together with the existence of a finite dimensional slow manifold defining non local hydrodynamics we discuss the merging of hydrodynamic modes as well as the existence of second sound and the appearance of ghost modes beneath the essential spectrum in dependence of the prandtl number\",\"we revisit the cluster expansion for ising lattice gauge theory on with wilson action at large but fixed inverse temperature  we prove existence and analyticity of the free energy infinite volume limit and compute the first few terms in its expansion in powers of  we further analyze wilson loop expectations and derive an estimate that shows how the lattice scale geometry of a loop is reflected in the large asymptotics of the wilson loop expectation specializing to axis parallel rectangular loops with side lengths and  we consider the limiting function  vbetar limt to infty fract log  langle wgammatr ranglebeta  known as the static quark potential in the physics literature we verify existence of the limit and compute the first few terms in the expansion of in powers of as for fixed and show that is bounded in for fixed large enough  we also treat as tend to infinity simultaneously and give analogous estimates for the dependent limit\",\"we develop a formula for the diagonal values of the hadamard coefficients associated to a normally hyperbolic operator on a globally hyperbolic spacetime in terms of the advanced and retarded greens operators we develop a local formula as well as formulae for integrals over parts of the diagonal furthermore we develop analogues of the hadamard expansion for powers of the advancedretarded greens operators and an analogue of a resolvent\",\"we remark that on a compact inner symmetric space  indowed with the riemmannian metric given by the killing form of signed changed the first non zero eigenvalue of the laplace operator on forms is the casimir eigenvalue of the highest either long or short root of  according as the highest weight of the isotropy representation is long or short some results for the first non zero eigenvalue on functions are derived this is a revision of the first version of the preprint a non correct statement about the spectrum on functions has been reviewed\",\"we consider a degenerate beam equation in presence of a leading operator which is not in divergence form we impose clamped conditions where the degeneracy occurs and dissipative conditions at the other endpoint we provide some conditions for the uniform exponential decay of solutions for the associated cauchy problem\",\"in this paper we give an effective method for finding a unique representative of each orbit of the adjoint and coadjoint action of the real affine orthogonal group on its lie algebra in both cases there are orbits which have a modulus that is different from the usual invariants for orthogonal groups we find an unexplained bijection between adjoint and coadjoint orbits as a special case we classify the adjoint and coadjoint orbits of the poincare group\",\"this work summarizes the most relevant background material that we have studied and proposes some problems that we will address in a forthcoming joint work we will consider with its canonical differentiable structure endowed with a group product and a riemannian metric  so that this space becomes a solvmanifold in this ambient space we will obtain the mean curvature flow equation of surfaces that satisfy certain symmetries\",\"in this paper we study the lipschitz continuous dependence of conservative holder continuous weak solutions to a variational wave system derived from a model for nematic liquid crystals since the solution of this system generally forms finite time cusp singularity the solution flow is not lipschitz continuous under the sobolev metric used in the existence and uniqueness theory we establish a finsler type optimal transport metric and show the lipschitz continuous dependence of solution on the initial data under this metric this kind of finsler type optimal transport metrics was first established in a bressan and g chen arch ration mech anal    for the scalar variational wave equation this equation can be used to describe the unit direction n of mean orientation of nematic liquid crystals when n is restricted on a circle the model considered in this paper describes the propagation of n without this restriction ie n takes any value on the unite sphere so we need to consider a wave system instead of a scalar equation\",\"a regular contact manifold is a manifold equipped with a globally defined contact form such that the topological space of orbits trajectories of the reeb vector field of carries a smooth manifold structure so the canonical projection is a smooth fibration we show that under the additional assumption that is a complete vector field this fibration is actually either an in this case is periodic or an principal bundle moreover there exists a unique symplectic form on such that  and is integral in the bundle

cluster algebra which in particular provides a new method different from that given by gross etc to present the positivity of cluster variables in the skew symmetrizable case and a conjecture on newton polytopes posed by fei is answered affirmatively for ii we know in rank case coincides with the greedy basis introduced by lee etc hence we can regard the polytope basis as a natural generalization of the greedy basis in any rank as application of iii the positivity of vectors associated to non initial cluster variables which was a conjecture raised is proved in a tsss cluster

theory and cvitanovics birdtracks for lie algebras category theory provides a robust framework in which to understand the nature of such diagrams and joyal and street formalized this framework by introducing string diagrams governed by the syntax of monoidal categories the notion of manifold diagrams generalizes string diagrams to higher dimensions and can be interpreted in higher categorical terms by a process of geometric dualization the closely related notion of tame tangles describes a well behaved class of embedded manifolds that can likewise be interpreted categorically in this paper we formally introduce the notions of manifold diagrams and of tame tangles and show that they admit a combinatorial classification by using results from the toolbox of framed combinatorial topology we then study the stability of tame tangles under perturbation the local forms of perturbation stable tame tangles provide combinatorial models of differential singularities as an illustration we describe various such combinatorial singularities in low dimensions we conclude by observing that all smooth manifolds can be presented as tame tangles and conjecture that the same is true for smooth manifolds of any dimension\",\"motivated by the problem of constructing explicit geometric string structures we give a rigid model for bundle gerbes and define connective structures thereon this model is designed to make explicit calculations easier for instance in applications to physics to compare to the existing definition we give a functorial construction of a bundle gerbe as in the literature from our rigid model including with connections as an example we prove that the chern simons bundle gerbe from the literature with its connective structure can be rigidified it arises up to isomorphism in the strongest possible sense from a rigid bundle gerbe with connective structure via this construction further our rigid version of gerbe trivialisation with connections gives rise to trivialisations with connections of bundle gerbes in the usual sense and as such can be used to describe geometric string structures\",\"multigraded betti numbers are one of the simplest invariants of multiparameter persistence modules this invariant is useful in theory it completely determines the hilbert function of the module and the isomorphism type of the free modules in its minimal free resolution as well as in practice it is easy to visualize and it is one of the main outputs of current multiparameter persistent homology software such as rivet however to the best of our knowledge no bottleneck stability result with respect to the interleaving distance has been established for this invariant so far and this potential lack of stability limits its practical applications we prove a stability result for multigraded betti numbers using an efficiently computable bottleneck type dissimilarity function we introduce our notion of matching is inspired by recent work on signed barcodes and allows matching bars of the same module in homological degrees of different parity in addition to matchings bars of different modules in homological degrees of the same parity our stability result

multiplicity of any eigenvalue of the laplacian on a closed hyperbolic surface of genus in the interval is at most despite the fact that this interval can contain arbitrarily many eigenvalues this extends a result of otal to a larger interval but with a weaker bound which nevertheless improves upon the general upper bound of sevennec\",\"the aim of this work is to investigate the properties and

functions are the minimal locally concave functions on parabolic strips in the plane now we describe the algorithm for constructing minimal locally concave functions on a planar domain that is a difference of two unbounded convex domains this leads to many sharp estimates for functions in the classes like   or the gehring classes\",\"we point out a class of trapping potentials in nonlinear schrodinger equations that make them non integrable but prevent the emergence of power spectra associated with ergodicity the potentials are characterized by equidistant energy spectra eg the harmonic oscillator trap and therefore by a large number of resonances enhancing the nonlinearity in a broad range of dynamical solutions spanning the regimes of both weak and strong nonlinearity the power spectra are shaped as narrow quasi discrete evenly spaced spikes unlike generic truly continuous ergodic spectra we develop an analytical explanation for the emergence of these spectral features in the case of weak nonlinearity in the strongly nonlinear regime the presence of such structures is tracked numerically by performing simulations with random initial conditions some potentials that prevent ergodicity in this manner are of direct relevance to bose einstein condensates they naturally enter d d and d gross pitaevskii equations gpes the quintic version of these equations and a two

and d type quiver structures using the intertwiners we briefly study the gaiotto state characters and the relation with quiver w algebra furthermore we show that the negative intertwiner corresponds to the anti refined topological vertex recently defined by kimura and sugimoto we also discuss how superquiver theories should appear in our formalism if they exist the existence of the agt

surfaces is completely settled\",\"previously it was suggested motivated by correspondence with jt gravity that tachyon correlators in minimal liouville gravity mlg in the semiclassical limit should be interpreted as moduli space volumes for constant curvature surfaces with conical defects in this work we propose that these volumes are associated with kahler metrics on moduli spaces introduced by zograf and takhtajan for which the classical liouville action is a kahler potential we check this proposal by numerical calculation of these kahler metrics and associated volumes for the simplest example of genus surface with conical defects using conformal field theory a peculiar property of mlg correlators is proportionality to number of conformal blocks in a certain region of parameter space in a particular limiting case we check this property for the volumes following from classical liouville action and thus provide an analytic confirmation of our proposal\",\"we develop filtered

demonstrate surprising new connections between these two domains for the first time employing symmetry directly to construct a flat output we provide sufficient conditions for the existence of a trivialization of the bundle in which the group variables themselves are a flat output we call this a geometric flat output since it is equivariant ie maintains the symmetry and is often global or almost global properties not typically enjoyed by other flat outputs in such a trivialization the motion planning problem is easily solved since a given trajectory for the group variables will fully

measurements one can identify the directions of largest and smallest curvature ie the principal curvatures and construct two surface invariants by taking the average and the product of the principal curvatures the product of the principal curvatures describes the intrinsic curvature of a surface and has profound importance in differential geometry evidenced by the gausss theorema egregium and the gauss bonnet theorem this curvature is commonly referred to as the gaussian curvature after carl friedrich gauss following his significant contributions to the emerging field of differential geometry in his work the average or mean curvature is an extrinsic measure of the shape of a surface that is the shape must be embedded in a higher dimensional space to be measured beginning in  and culminating in efforts in and  the mathematician sophie germain identified the mean curvature as the appropriate measure for describing the shape of vibrating plates her hypothesis leads directly to the equations describing the behavior of thin elastic plates in letters to gauss she described her notion of a sphere of mean curvature that can be identified at each point on the surface this

topological codes we define local reversibility in context of measurement circuits which allows us to treat finite depth measurement circuits on a similar footing to finite depth unitary circuits in contrast to the unitary case a finite depth locally reversible measurement sequence can implement a translation in one dimension a locally reversible measurement sequence in two dimensions may also induce a flow of logical information along the boundary we introduce measurement quantum cellular automata which unifies these ideas and define an index in one dimension to characterize the flow of logical operators we find a bulk invariant for floquet topological codes which indicates an obstruction to having a trivial boundary we prove that the hastings haah honeycomb code belong to a class with such obstruction which means that any boundary must have either non local dynamics period doubled or admits boundary flow of quantum information\",\"recent works have explored relations between

triangular bases for such algebras the definition is a graded extension of the notion of triangular basis introduced in previous joint work with stroppel however in the general graded setting finitely generated projective modules often fail to be noetherian so that existing results from the study of highest weight categories are not directly applicable nevertheless we show that there is still a good theory of standard modules in motivating examples arising from kac moody categories these modules categorify the pbw bases for the modified forms of quantum groups constructed by

problem of finding a rigid alignment of the views that minimizes a norm based alignment error in general the views are noisy and a perfect alignment may not exist in this work we characterize the non degeneracy of an alignment in the noisy setting based on the kernel and positivity of a certain matrix this leads to a polynomial time algorithm for testing the non degeneracy of a given alignment consequently we focus on riemannian gradient descent for minimization of the error and obtain a sufficient condition on an alignment for the algorithm to converge locally linearly to it in the case of noiseless views a perfect alignment exists resulting in a realization of the points that respects the geometry of the views under a mild condition on the views we show that the non degeneracy of a

relations is directly inspired from the known case of  our first main result is to prove the existence of automorphisms of satisfying the relations of the braid group on strands we also show the existence of coproduct maps relating the algebras for different values of  an immediate consequence of our approach is that the askey wilson algebra defined here surjects onto the algebra generated by the intermediate casimir elements in the fold tensor product of the quantum group or equivalently onto the kauffman bracket skein algebra of the punctured sphere we also obtain a family of central

the permeability take negative values additionally we assume that the interface between the two domains is smooth everywhere except at a point where it coincides locally with a conical tip in this context it is known that for certain critical values of the contrasts in and in  the corresponding scalar operators are not of fredholm type in the usual spaces in this work we show that in these situations the maxwells equations are not well posed in the classical framework due to existence of hypersingular fields which are of infinite energy at the tip by combining the coercivity approach and the kondratiev theory we explain how to construct new functional frameworks to recover well posedness of the maxwells problem we also explain how to select the setting which is consistent with the limiting absorption principle from a technical point of view the fields as well as their curls decompose as the sum of an explicit singular part related to the black hole singularities of the scalar operators and a smooth part belonging to some weighted spaces the analysis we propose rely in particular on the proof of new key results of scalar and vector potential representations of singular fields\",\"we classify all quotients up to isomorphism in bruhat order with a coxeter system and a parabolic subgroup of  in particular the non trivial isomorphisms fall into a small number of cases

quantum situations their evaluation is also simpler the paper displays a number of explicit formulae and evaluation procedures that may speed up some computer programs these two integer valued functions are unusual in that their properties do not appear to be often discussed in the literature but their features reflect those of related real valued functions discussed in many places some of the properties that we shall discuss seem however to be new in particular several relations between the function gon and the inverse hilbert matrices\",\"we construct the jucys murphy elements and the

the pointwise decay of solutions to wave type equations in two model singular settings our main result is a form of prices law for solutions of the massless dirac coulomb system in  dimensions using identical techniques we prove a similar theorem for the wave equation on minkowski space with an inverse square potential one novel feature of these singular models is that solutions exhibit two different leading decay rates at timelike infinity in two regimes distinguished by whether the spatial momentum along a curve which approaches timelike infinity is zero or non zero an important feature of our analysis is that it yields a precise description of solutions at the interface of these two regions which comprise the whole of timelike infinity\",\"we introduce the stable module

irreversibility unilateral equilibrium of an energy and an energy conservation law which cannot generally be realized in dissipative systems such as standard gradient flows main results consist of well posedness in a strong formulation qualitative properties of strong solutions ie comparison principle and the three properties mentioned above and long time dynamics of strong solutions more precisely convergence to an equilibrium the well posedness will be proved based on a minimizing movement scheme without parabolic regularization which will also play a crucial role for proving qualitative and asymptotic properties of strong solutions moreover the variational inequality under consideration will be characterized as a singular limit of some generalized gradient flows\",\"in this note we discuss an integral representation for the vertex function of the cotangent bundle over the grassmannian  this integral representation can be used to compute the limit of the vertex function where denotes the equivariant parameter of a torus acting on by dilating the cotangent fibers we show that in this limit the integral turns into the standard mirror integral representation

distribution and slant submanifold in the settings of an almost hermitian an almost product riemannian an almost contact metric and an almost paracontact metric manifold and study some of their properties we prove that for any proper slant distribution in the tangent bundle of a riemannian manifold there exists another one in its orthogonal complement and we establish basic relations metric properties formulae relating the involved tensor fields conformal properties between them furthermore allowing the slant angles to depend on the points of the manifold we generalize these concepts and those of pointwise slant distribution and pointwise slant submanifold to the concepts of pointwise slant distribution and pointwise slant submanifold in the above mentioned settings for any pointwise slant distribution we prove the existence of a corresponding one in its orthogonal complement and reveal basic relations between them we also provide sufficient conditions for pointwise slant distributions to become slant distributions and establish other related results by the end for the fulfilment of some specific requirements we introduce a special class of pointwise slant distributions that of pointwise slant distributions and the corresponding class of submanifolds pointwise slant submanifolds which is slightly more general than the class of generic submanifolds in sense of ronsse getting new results\",\"we classify the volume preserving stable hypersurfaces in the real projective space  as a consequence the solutions of the isoperimetric problem are tubular neighborhoods of projective subspaces starting with points this confirms a conjecture of burago and zalgaller from and extends to higher dimensions previous result of m ritore and a ros on  we also derive an willmore type inequality for antipodal invariant hypersurfaces in \",\"we study the variational problem of finding the fastest path between two points that belong to different anisotropic media each with a prescribed speed profile and a common interface the optimal curves are finsler geodesics that are refracted broken as they pass through the interface due to the discontinuity of their velocities this breaking must satisfy a specific condition in terms of the finsler metrics defined by the speed profiles thus establishing the generalized snells law in the same way optimal paths bouncing off the interface without crossing into the second domain provide the generalized law of reflection the classical snells and reflection laws are recovered in this setting when the velocities are isotropic if one considers a wave that propagates in all directions from a given ignition point the trajectories that globally minimize the traveltime generate the wavefront at each instant of time we study in detail the global properties of such wavefronts in the euclidean plane with anisotropic speed profiles like the individual rays they break when they encounter the discontinuity interface but they are also broken due to the formation of cut loci stemming from the self intersection of the wavefronts which typically appear when they approach a high speed profile

study the regularity and stability for solutions to the conductivity problems with degenerate coefficients in the presence of two rigid conductors as one conductor keeps motionless and another conductor moves in some direction by a sufficiently small translational distance we will show that the solutions are smooth and stable with respect to the small translational distance our results contain the following three cases two perfect conductors two insulators a perfect conductor and an insulator further we extend the results to the elasticity problem modeled by the lame system with partially infinite coefficients\",\"we show that if and are two transverse minimal foliations on then either they intersect in an anosov foliation or there exists a reeb surface in the intersection foliation the existence of a reeb surface is incompatible with partially hyperbolic foliations so we deduce from this that certain partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms in unit tangent bundles are collapsed anosov flows we also conclude that every volume preserving partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism of a unit tangent bundle is ergodic\",\"we show that the same algebraic data that permit to construct the lax pair and the matrix of an integrable non linear model in dimensions can be also used for the construction of lax pairs and of matrices of several other non trivial integrable

viro invariants for an ideally triangulated compact manifold with non empty boundary and a coloring on the edges generalizing the turaev viro invariants  of the manifold we also propose the volume conjecture for these invariants whose asymptotic behavior is related to the volume of the manifold in the hyperbolic polyhedral metric   with singular locus the edges and cone angles determined by the coloring and prove the conjecture in the case that the cone angles are sufficiently small this suggests an approach of solving the volume conjecture for the turaev viro invariants proposed by chen yang  for hyperbolic manifolds with totally geodesic boundary\",\"in this paper we study the uniqueness of weak solutions of the plateau flow which was first introduced by wettstein as a half laplacian heat flow and recently studied by struwe using alternative methods this geometric gradient flow is of interest due to its links with free boundary minimal surfaces and the plateau problem we obtain uniqueness of weak solutions of this flow under a natural condition on the energy which answers positively a question raised by struwe\",\"a quantum symmetric pair consists of a quantum group and its coideal subalgebra called an quantum group with parameters  in this note we use the derived hall algebras of periodic complexes to realize the quantum groups of split type\",\"our aim is twofold first we rigorously analyse the generators of quantum dynamical semigroups of thermodynamic processes we characterise a wide class of gksl generators for quantum maps within thermal operations and argue that every infinitesimal generator of a one parameter semigroup of markovian thermal operations belongs to this class we completely classify and visualise them and their non markovian counterparts for the case of a single qubit second we use this description in the framework of bilinear control systems to characterise reachable sets of coherently controllable quantum systems with switchable coupling to a thermal bath the core problem reduces to studying a hybrid control system toy model on the standard simplex allowing for two types of evolution i instantaneous permutations

means of modern geometry there has always been a mysterious and fascinating ambiguous link between geometric topological and dynamical characteristics with quantum entanglement since geometry studies the interrelations between elements such as distance and curvature it provides the information sciences with powerful structures that yield practically useful and understandable descriptions of integrable quantum systems we explore here these structures in a physical system of interaction spin under all range ising model by performing the system dynamics we determine the fubini study metric defining the relevant quantum state space applying gaussian curvature within the scope of the gauss bonnet theorem we proved that the dynamics happens on a closed two dimensional manifold having both a dumbbell shape structure and a spherical topology the geometric and topological phases appearing during the system evolution processes are sufficiently discussed subsequently we resolve the quantum brachistochrone problem by achieving the time optimal evolution by restricting the whole system to a two spin system we investigate the relevant entanglement from two viewpoints the first is of geometric nature and explores how the entanglement level affects derived geometric structures such as the fubini study metric the gaussian curvature and the geometric phase the second is of dynamic nature and addresses the entanglement effect on the evolution speed and the related fubini study distance further depending on the degree of entanglement we resolve the quantum brachistochrone

thermal relaxation asymmetry challenged the local equilibrium paradigm valid near equilibrium because the intuition and proof hinged on the dynamics obeying detailed balance the asymmetry was expected to break down in systems with irreversible dynamics contrary to intuition we here prove the relaxation asymmetry for systems driven out of equilibrium by a general linear drift the asymmetry persists due to a non trivial isomorphism between driven and reversible processes moreover rotational motions emerge at strong driving that strikingly occur in opposite directions during heating and cooling this highlights that noisy systems do not relax by passing through local equilibria\",\"these are detailed lecture notes of the crash course on shuffle algebras delivered by the author at tokyo

natural class of nonholonomic systems has not been treated before we put a special emphasis on the important subclass of such systems with magnetic forces the existence of an invariant measure and the problem of hamiltonization are studied both within the lagrangian and the almost hamiltonian framework in addition we introduce problems of rolling of a ball with the gyroscope without slipping and twisting over a plane and over a sphere in as examples of gyroscopic chaplygin systems we describe an invariant measure and provide examples of symmetric systems ball with gyroscope that allow the chaplygin hamiltonization in the case of additional symmetry we prove that the obtained magnetic geodesic flows on the sphere are integrable in particular we introduce the generalized demchenko case in  where the inertia operator of the system is proportional to the identity operator the reduced systems are automatically hamiltonian and represent the magnetic geodesic flows on the spheres endowed with the round sphere metric under the influence of a homogeneous magnetic field the magnetic geodesic flow problem on the two dimensional sphere is well known but for was not studied before we perform explicit integrations in elliptic functions of the systems for and  and provide the case study of the solutions in both situations\",\"this paper is an introduction to polarizations in the symplectic and orthogonal settings they arise in association to a triple of compatible structures on a real vector space consisting of an inner product a symplectic form and a complex structure a polarization is a decomposition of the complexified vector space into the eigenspaces of the complex structure this information is equivalent to the specification of a compatible triple when either a symplectic form or inner product is fixed one obtains a grassmannian of polarizations we give an exposition of this circle of ideas emphasizing the symmetry of the symplectic and orthogonal settings and allowing the possibility that the underlying vector spaces are infinite dimensional this introduction would be useful for those interested in applications of polarizations to representation theory

calculate the harish chandra images of the sugawara operators and identify them with the eigenvalues of the operators acting in the deformed wakimoto modules\",\"we formulate the knapsack problem kp as a statistical physics system and compute the corresponding partition function as an integral in the complex plane the introduced formalism allows us to derive three statistical physics based algorithms for the kp one based on the recursive definition of the exact partition function another based on the large weight limit of that partition function and a final one based on the zero temperature limit of the second comparing the performances of the algorithms we find that they do not consistently outperform in terms of runtime and accuracy dynamic programming annealing or standard greedy algorithms however the exact partition function is shown to reproduce the dynamic programming solution to the kp and the zero temperature algorithm is shown to produce a greedy solution therefore although dynamic programming and greedy solutions to the kp are conceptually distinct the statistical physics formalism introduced in this work reveals that the large weight constraint limit of the former leads to the latter we conclude by discussing how to extend this formalism in order to obtain more accurate versions of the introduced algorithms and to other similar combinatorial optimization problems\",\"let be a field a connected reductive group and a finite group in a previous work the authors defined what it means for a connected reductive group to be parascopic for  roughly this is a simultaneous generalization of several settings for example could act on  and could be the connected part of the group of fixed points in  or could be an endoscopic group a pseudo levi subgroup or an isogenous image of  if is such a group and both and are quasisplit then we constructed a map from the set of stable semisimple conjugacy classes in the dual to the set of such

prove that our model is locally well posed and does not degenerate under a smallness assumption on the pressure data in the westervelt equation in addition we perform a singular limit analysis and show that the westervelt pennes fourier model can be seen as an approximation of the westervelt pennes cattaneo model as the relaxation parameter tends to zero this is done by deriving uniform bounds

model in the limiting case of infinitely strong repulsion we find that in the absence of bias the transport is diffusive and derive the spin diffusion constant our approach is based on asymptotic analysis of a fredholm determinant representation the obtained results are in agreement with generalized hydrodynamics approach\",\"we apply perturbative techniques to two systems known to show resonant behaviour a driven oscillator and a parametric oscillator without damping we look at the behaviour at resonance and find that in the former case the finite resonant behaviour can be attributed to alternating signs of amplitudes with long term divergences in various perturbative orders giving rise to an interference like effect in the second part of the article we look at a parametric oscillator at resonance and apply krylov bogoliubov averaging to analyse the same in general we show that our approximate solution matches the exact solution over a timescale that increases

infinitesimal models an interesting natural construction with the ability to interpolate between algebra and geometry\",\"we present oseen equations on lipschitz domains in a port hamiltonian context such equations arise for instance by linearization of the navier stokes equations in our setup the external port consists of the boundary traces of velocity and the normal component of the stress

matter ranging from spontaneous symmetry breaking phases quantum critical points to topologically ordered states it is far from clear however whether entanglement measures such as the entanglement entropy ee can actually be obtained with the precision required to observe these subtle features usually in the form of universal finite size scaling behavior in highly entangled quantum matter in the case of d interacting fermionic lattice models with gapless spectra such as in the hubbard model the computation of the ee has faced severe limitations making reliable data in the universal scaling regime off limits to all existing numerical algorithms here we explain the reason for the previously unsuccessful attempts in ee computations in quantum monte carlo simulations and more importantly show how to overcome the conceptual and computational barrier with the incremental algorithm such that the computation of the ee in d interacting fermion systems finally becomes easy and reliable\",\"we provide a formal derivation of a reduced model for twisted bilayer graphene tbg from density functional theory our derivation is based on a variational approximation of the tbg kohn sham hamiltonian and asymptotic limit techniques in contrast with other approaches it does not require the introduction of an intermediate tight binding model the so obtained model is similar to that of the bistritzer macdonald bm model but contains additional terms its parameters can be easily computed from kohn sham calculations on single layer graphene and untwisted bilayer graphene with different stackings it allows one in particular to estimate the parameters and of the bm model from first principles the resulting numerical values namely mev for the experimental interlayer mean

kamnitzer morrison whose objects are monoidally generated by the standard representation and its dual is equivalent as a spherical braided category to a quotient category defined using sikoras

processes the first is the zero electron mass limit which formally results to the non linear adiabatic electron system in a second step we analyze the combined zero electron mass and quasi neutral limits which together lead to the compressible euler equations using the relative energy method we rigorously justify these limiting processes for dissipative weak solutions of the bipolar euler poisson system and for strong and bounded away from vacuum solutions of the limit systems the justification is valid in the regime of initial data that strong solutions exist to deal with the electric

problem for non divergence second order elliptic operators  and especially the normalized adjoints of such operators in particular our results are applicable to the case of real coefficients having sufficiently small bmo norm we assume that the coefficients of the operator are smooth but our estimates do not depend on the assumption of smoothness\",\"for half a century mackey and green functors have been successfully used to model the induction and restriction maps which are ubiquitous in the representation theory of finite groups in the examples the latter maps are typically distilled in some way from induction and restriction functors between additive categories this naturally leads to the notions of mackey and green functors and to axioms which better capture this underlying layer of information such structures have been used in algebra geometry and topology for a long time we survey examples and applications of this young yet arguably overdue theory\",\"davydov yetter cohomology classifies infinitesimal deformations of tensor categories and of tensor functors our first result is that davydov yetter cohomology for finite tensor categories is equivalent to the cohomology of a comonad arising from the central hopf monad this has several applications first we obtain a short and conceptual proof of ocneanu rigidity second it allows to use standard methods from

the latter intertwiners in terms of stable maps to deduce an analogous factorization for our new braidings we finally obtain as byproducts new relations for the grothendieck ring as well as a functorial interpretation of a remarkable ring isomorphism of hernandez leclerc\",\"for a finite group  we study categorical factorisation homology on oriented surfaces equipped with principal bundles which integrates a linear balanced braided category with action over those surfaces for surfaces with at least one boundary component we identify the value of factorisation homology with the category of modules over an explicit algebra in  extending the work of ben zvi brochier and jordan to surfaces with bundles furthermore we show that the value of factorisation homology on annuli boundary conditions and point defects can be described in terms of equivariant representation theory our main example comes from an action of dynkin diagram automorphisms on representation categories of quantum groups we show that in this case factorisation homology gives rise to a quantisation of the moduli space of flat twisted bundles\",\"the classical pieri formula gives a multiplicity free expansion of an irreducible module with a fundamental one for the complex general linear group in this article we replace the tensor product by the fusion product and prove an analogue pieri formula for higher level demazure modules for the affine lie algebra  to be more precise we show that the fusion product of an arbitrary stable demazure module with a fundamental module admits a multiplicity free excellent filtration and the successive quotients are described explicitly as a consequence we derive recurrence relations for the generating series encoding the numerical multiplicities in demazure flags of level one demazure modules\",\"we discuss the curtright zachos cz deformation of the virasoro algebra and its extentions in terms of magnetic translation mt group in a discrete bloch electron system so called the tight binding model tbm as well as in its continuous system we verify that the cz generators are essentially composed of a specific combination of mt operators representing deformed and undeformed translational groups which determine phase factors for a bracket commutator the phase factors can be formulated as a ordered product of the commutable operators by interpreting the ab phase factor of discrete mt action as fluctuation parameter of a quantum plane we also show that some sequences of tbm hamiltonians are described by the cz generators\",\"an

second fundamental form the first few residues are computed when and \",\"we develop a diagrammatic calculus for representations of unrolled quantum at a fourth root of unity this allows us to prove seifert torres type formulas for certain splice links using quantum algebraic methods rather than topological methods other applications of this diagrammatic calculus given here are a skein relation for cabled double crossings and a simple proof that the quantum invariant associated with these representations determines the multivariable alexander polynomial\",\"using probabilistic methods we establish a priori estimates for two classes of quasilinear parabolic systems of partial differential equations pdes we treat in particular the case of a nonlinearity which has quadratic growth in the

applications of our estimates discussed here are harnack type inequalities liouville type theorems and a local time reversed harnack inequality\",\"we show that modular operads are equivalent to modules over a certain simple properad which we call the brauer properad furthermore we show that in this setting the feynman transform corresponds to the cobar construction for modules of this kind to make this precise we extend the machinery of the bar and cobar constructions relative to a twisting morphism to modules over a general properad this generalizes the classical case of algebras over an operad and might be of independent interest as an application we sketch a koszul duality theory for modular operads\",\"the number of lame equations with finite ordinary or projective monodromy has been conjectured by s r dahmen and a few proofs have been proposed it is known that lame equations with unitary monodromy are corresponding to spherical tori with one conical singularity and the geometry of such surfaces had been studied with triangulation recently in this paper we will apply the results on spherical tori to give an alternative proof of dahmens conjectures\",\"we show a mathematically precise version of the syz conjecture proposed in the family floer context for the conifold with a conjectural mirror relation between smoothing and crepant resolution the singular t duality fibers are explicitly written and exactly correspond to the codimension missing points in the mirror cluster variety which confirms the speculation of chan pomerleano and ueda but only in the non archimedean setting concerning purely the area of berkovich geometry and forgetting all the mirror symmetry background our b side analytic fibration is also a new explicit example of affinoid torus fibration with singular extension\",\"we prove uniqueness of smooth isometric immersions within the class of negatively curved corrugated two dimensional immersions embedded into  the main tool we use is the relative entropy method employed in the setting of differential geometry for the gauss codazzi system the result allows us to compare also two solutions to the gauss codazzi system that

study whittaker vectors and jacquet integrals in the generalized principal series for a real reductive group a functional equation for them is obtained this allows to establish uniform estimates for their holomorphic extensions with respect to the continuous induction parameter finally we link the whittaker vectors to harish chandras whittaker integrals for which we then prove uniform tempered estimates this allows us to establish rapid decay for a class of fourier transforms on the space of whittaker schwartz functions\",\"we define a large new class of symplectic manifolds which includes all conical symplectic resolutions they come with a pseudoholomorphic c action whose s part is hamiltonian and admit at infinity a pseudoholomorphic s equivariant map to a positive symplectisation we construct a filtration by ideals on their quantum cohomology and we show that this filtration is sensitive to the choice of c action in particular this determines a family of filtrations on singular cohomology for any conical symplectic resolution these filtrations can be viewed as a floer theoretic analogue of atiyah bott filtrations arising from stratifying a manifold by gradient flowlines of a morse bott function but they are distinct from those and they can detect non topological properties of the quantum product our main tool is the construction and computation of symplectic cohomology for these spaces\",\"circuit quantization is an extraordinarily successful theory that describes the behavior of quantum circuits with high precision the most widely used approach of circuit quantization relies on introducing a classical lagrangian whose degrees of freedom are either magnetic fluxes or electric charges in the circuit by combining nonlinear circuit elements such as josephson junctions or quantum phase slips it is possible to build circuits where a standard lagrangian description and thus the standard quantization method does not exist inspired by the mathematics

sublaplacian generalizing observations of frank gonzalez monticelli tan\",\"we consider elastic flows of closed curves in euclidean space we obtain optimal energy thresholds below which elastic flows preserve embeddedness of initial curves for all time the obtained thresholds take different values between codimension one and higher the main novelty lies in the case of codimension one where we obtain the variational characterization that the thresholding shape is a minimizer of the bending energy normalized by length among all nonembedded planar closed curves of unit rotation number it turns out that a minimizer is uniquely given by a nonclassical shape which we call elastic two teardrop\",\"we study the quasi ergodicity of compact strong feller semigroups   on  we assume that is a locally compact polish space equipped with a locally finite borel measue  the operators are ultracontractive and positivity preserving but not necessarily self adjoint or normal we are mainly interested in those cases where the measure is infinite and the semigroup is not intrinsically ultracontractive we relate quasi ergodicity on and uniqueness of the quasi stationary measure with the finiteness of the heat content of the semigroup for large values of  and with the progressive uniform ground state domination property the latter property is equivalent to a variant of quasi

quantum representations also known as the fibonacci representations of mapping class groups are locally rigid more generally for any prime level  we prove that the level quantum representations are locally rigid on all surfaces of genus if and only if they are locally rigid on surfaces of genus with at most boundary components this reduces local rigidity in prime level to a finite number of cases\",\"we investigate the situation when a normal positive linear unital map on a semifinite von neumann algebra leaving the trace invariant does not change fixed quantum renyis entropy of the density of a normal state it is also shown that such a map does not change the entropy of any density if and only if it is a jordan  isomorphism on the algebra\",\"in this work we investigate the sobolev space on a strong lipschitz boundary  ie is a strong lipschitz domain in most of the literature this space is defined via charts and sobolev spaces on flat domains we show that there is a

represent the cells by diagrams showing clearly the inclusions as well as the actions of the group of symmetries and of its remarkable subgroups\",\"relative fukaya categories are hard to construct in this paper we provide a very explicit construction in the case of punctured surfaces the starting point is the gentle algebra associated with a punctured surface  our model for the relative fukaya

surfaces\",\"we study the twisted poincare duality of smooth poisson manifolds and show that if the modular vector field is diagonalizable then there is a mixed complex associated to the poisson complex which combining with the twisted poincare duality gives a batalin vilkovisky algebra structure on the poisson cohomology this generalizes the previous results obtained by xu for unimodular poisson manifolds we also show that the batalin vilkovisky algebra structure is preserved under kontsevichs deformation quantization and in the case of polynomial algebras it is also preserved by

et al bgs constructed a minimal free resolution of except differential maps the present paper constructs the differential maps and also gives an elementary proof of the result of bgs\",\"this book provides a systematic study of spectral and scattering theory for many body schrodinger operators at two cluster thresholds while the two body problem reduced after separation of the center of mass motion to a one body problem at zero energy is a well studied subject the literature on the many body problem is sparse however our analysis covers for example the system of three particles interacting by coulomb potentials and restricted to a small energy region to the right of a fixed nonzero two body eigenvalue  in general we address the question how does scattering quantities for the

are graded by a qubit this model is so simple that it may be implemented as a quantum simulation of the mass enhancement taking place when supersymmetry susy is spontaneously broken here our quantum simulation means the realization of the target quantum phenomenon with some quantum information devices as a physical reality the model describes how the quasi particle consisting of the annihilation

hold and propose ways to facilitate the satisfaction of these two conditions together\",\"the widths of a closed riemannian manifold are a nonlinear analogue of the spectrum of its laplace beltrami operator which corresponds to areas of a certain min max sequence of possibly singular minimal submanifolds we show that the widths of any closed riemannian two manifold correspond to a union of closed immersed geodesics rather than simply geodesic nets we then prove optimality of the sweepouts of the round two sphere constructed from the zero set of homogeneous polynomials showing that the widths of the round sphere are attained by great circles as a result we find the universal constant in the liokumovich marques neves weyl law for surfaces to be  en route to calculating the widths of

affine hecke algebra should admit a description in terms of the grothedieck group of sheaves on the square of a finite set equivariant under the action of the centralizer of a nilpotent element in the reductive group a weaker form of this statement allowing for possible central extensions of stabilizers of that action has been proved by the first named author with ostrik in the present paper we describe an example showing that nontrivial central extensions do arise thus the above weaker statement is optimal we also show that lusztigs homomorphism from the affine hecke algebra to the

show that these conditions are almost sufficient in the sense that whenever the conditions are satisfied one can associate a automatically unique symmetric universal product with the prescribed highest coefficients furthermore we give a quite explicit description of such families of coefficients thereby producing a list of candidates that must contain all positive symmetric universal

the conformal gauss map converges to a light like geodesic in the de sitter space\",\"we analyze the perturbative relativistic moduli space approach where the amplitudes of the derrick modes are promoted to collective coordinates in particular we analyse the possibility to calculate the critical velocity ie the initial velocity of kinks at which single bounce scattering changes into a multi bounce or annihilation collision in the resulting collective coordinate model ccm we find that for a growing number of modes the critical velocity of the ccm approaches the full field theory value this is verified in the case of the model where we reach a accuracy we also see such a convergence for a wide range of models belonging to the family of the double sine gordon and christ lee theories especially in those cases where the kinks do not reveal a too well pronounced half kink inner structure\",\"we prove solenoidal injectivity for the geodesic x ray transform of tensor fields on simple riemannian manifolds with metrics and non positive sectional curvature the proof of the result rests on pestov energy estimates for a transport equation on the non smooth unit sphere bundle of the manifold our low regularity setting requires keeping track of regularity and making use of many functions on the sphere bundle having more vertical than horizontal regularity some of the methods such

weak exceptional sequences over these algebras finally we explain how our result relates to a similar combinatorial model for the exceptional sequences over hereditary algebras of type a\",\"we demonstrate that the most probable state of a conserved system with a limited number of entities or molecules is the state where non gaussian and non chi square distributions govern we have conducted a thought experiment using a specific setup we have verified the mathematical derivation of the most probable state accurately predicts the results obtained by computer simulations the derived

implementation a recently proposed approach called probabilistic state synthesis where the circuit is probabilistically sampled to turn such coherent errors into incoherent ones is able to reduce the order of the approximation error compared to conventional deterministic synthesis in this paper we demonstrate that the optimal probabilistic synthesis quadratically reduces the approximation error

linear response time dependent density functional theory lr tddft first we present a functional analytic setting that allows for a unified treatment of the dyson equation with general adiabatic approximations for discrete finite and infinite and continuum systems in this setting we derive a representation formula for the solution of the dyson equation in terms of an operator version of the casida matrix while the casida matrix is well known in the physics literature its general formulation as an unbounded operator in the n body wavefunction space appears to be new moreover we derive several consequences of the solution formula obtained here in particular we discuss the stability of the solution and characterize the maximal meromorphic extension of its fourier transform we then show that for adiabatic approximations satisfying a suitable compactness condition the maximal domains of meromorphic continuation of the initial density density response function and the solution of

vafa in as a convincing yet mysterious correspondence between certain symmetry patterns in toroidal compactifications of m theory and del pezzo surfaces both governed by the root system series  it turns out that the sequence of del pezzo surfaces is not the only sequence of objects in mathematics that gives rise to the same symmetry pattern we present a sequence of topological spaces starting with the four sphere  and then forming its iterated cyclic loop spaces  within which we discover the symmetry pattern via rational homotopy theory for this sequence of spaces the correspondence between its symmetry pattern and that of toroidal compactifications of m theory is no longer a mystery as each space is naturally related to the compactification of m theory on the torus via identification of the equations of motion of dimensional supergravity as the defining equations of the sullivan minimal model of  this gives an explicit duality between algebraic topology and physics

we study their diffeological properties from different aspects in a systematic fashion with respect to the germs of plots we also discuss notions of embeddings of diffeological spaces and regard diffeological embeddings similar to those of manifolds in particular we show that diffeological embeddings are inductions in order to characterize the considered maps from their linear behaviors we introduce a class of diffeological spaces so called diffeological etale manifolds which not only contains the usual manifolds but also includes irrational tori we state and prove versions of the rank and implicit function theorems as well as the fundamental theorem on flows in this class as an application we use the results of this work to facilitate the computations of the internal tangent spaces and diffeological dimensions in a few interesting cases\",\"in  a theory of universal extensions in abelian categories is developed in particular the notion of ext universal object is presented in the present paper we show that an ab abelian category which is ext small satisfies the ab condition if and only if each one of its objects is ext universal we also give a characterization of the co ext universal objects of the category of torsion abelian groups in particular we show that such groups are the ones admitting a decomposition  in which is injective and is a reduced group on which each component is bounded\",\"we deal with suitable nonlinear versions of jaureguis isocapacitary mass in manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature and compact outermost minimal boundary these masses which depend on a parameter  interpolate between jaureguis mass and huiskens isoperimetric mass as  we derive positive mass theorems for these masses under mild conditions at infinity and we show that these masses do coincide with the mass when the latter is defined we finally work out a nonlinear potential theoretic proof of the penrose inequality in the optimal asymptotic regime\",\"we consider the class of compact hermitian manifolds whose chern connection is ambrose singer namely it has parallel torsion and curvature we prove structure theorems for such manifolds\",\"let be a morphism of algebras the goal of this paper is to describe restriction of scalars in the setting of modules and prove that it defines a functor  a more abstract approach to this problem was recently given by kraft schnitzer in a subsequent paper this result is applied to show that there is a well defined module structure on the sutured annular khovanov homology of a link in a thickened annulus\",\"in this article we study the isotropy stratification of a linear representation of a compact lie group  we prove that the closed isotropy strata are real algebraic manifolds and that for each isotropy subgroup  every rational invariant of the induced representation can be obtained as the restriction of a global invariant of  where is the normalizer of and is the fixed point set of \",\"in this study we consider the positive cluster complex a full subcomplex of a cluster complex the vertices of which are all non initial cluster variables in particular we provide a formula for the difference in face vectors of positive cluster complexes caused by a mutation for finite type moreover we explicitly describe specific positive cluster complexes of finite type and calculate their face vectors we also provide a method to compute the face vector of an arbitrary positive cluster complex of finite type using these results furthermore we apply our results to the tilting theory of cluster tilted algebras of finite representation type using the correspondence between clusters and support tilting modules\",\"we prove that any positive solution of the yamabe equation on an asymptotically flat dimensional manifold of flatness order at least and must converge at infinity either to a fundamental solution of the laplace operator on the euclidean space or to a radial fowler solution defined on the entire euclidean space the flatness order is the minimal flatness order required to define adm mass in general relativity the dimension is the dividing dimension of the validity of compactness of solutions to the yamabe problem we also prove such alternatives for bounded solutions when  we prove these results by establishing appropriate asymptotic behavior near an isolated singularity of solutions to the yamabe equation when the metric has a flatness order of at least at the singularity and  also when and the solution grows no faster than the fundamental solution of the flat metric laplacian at the singularity these results extend earlier results of l caffarelli b gidas and j spruck also of n korevaar r mazzeo f pacard and r schoen when the metric is conformally flat and work of cc chen and c s lin when the scalar curvature is a non constant function with appropriate flatness at the singular point also work of f marques when the metric is not necessarily conformally flat but smooth and the dimension of the manifold is three four or five as well as recent similar results by the second and third authors in dimension six\",\"the problem of efficiently generating random samples from high dimensional and non log concave posterior measures arising from nonlinear regression problems is considered extending investigations from arxiv local and global stability properties of the model are identified under which such posterior distributions can be approximated in wasserstein distance by suitable log concave measures this allows the use of fast gradient based sampling algorithms for which convergence guarantees are established that scale polynomially in all relevant quantities assuming warm initialisation the scope of the general theory is illustrated in a non linear inverse problem from integral geometry for which new stability results are derived\",\"we prove new criteria for essential self adjointness of pseudodifferential operators which do not involve ellipticity type assumptions for example we show that self adjointness holds in case that the symbol is with derivatives of order two and higher being uniformly bounded these results also apply to hermitian operator valued symbols on infinite dimensional hilbert spaces which are important to applications in physics our method relies on a phase space differential calculus for quadratic forms on  calderon vaillancourt type theorems and a recent self adjointness result for toeplitz operators on the segal bargmann space developed in \",\"the interplay between variational functionals and the brunn minkowski theory is currently a well established phenomenon that has been widely investigated in the last thirty years in this work we prove the existence of solutions to the even logarithmic minkowski problems arising from functionals such as the first eigenvalue of the laplacian and the torsional rigidity moreover we lay down a blueprint to obtain the same result for more generic functionals we show how these results imply self similar solutions to variational flow problems a la fireys worn stone problem we conclude with showing analogues of minkowskis first inequality for such functionals\",\"to each triangulation of any surface with marked points on the boundary and orbifold points of order three we associate a quiver with loops with potential whose jacobian algebra is finite dimensional and gentle we study the stability scattering diagrams of such gentle algebras and use them to prove that the caldero chapoton map defines a bijection between reachable rigid pairs and cluster monomials of the generalized cluster algebra associated to the surface by chekhov and shapiro\",\"in this paper we study non isochoric models for mixtures of solid particles at high volume concentration and a gas one of the motivations of this work concerns geophysics and more particularly the pyroclastic density currents which are precisely mixtures of pyroclast and lithic fragments and air they are extremely destructive phenomena capable of devastating urbanised areas and are known to propagate over long distances even over almost flat topography fluidisation of these dense granular flows by pore gas pressure is one response that could explain this behaviour and must therefore be taken into account in the models starting from a gas solid mixing model and invoking the compressibility of the gas through a law of state we rewrite the conservation of mass equation of the gas phase into an equation on the pore gas pressure whose net effect is to reduce the friction between the particles the momentum equation of the solid phase is completed by generic constitutive laws specified as in schaeffer et al  journal of fluid mechanics   by a yield function and a dilatancy function therefore the divergence of the velocity field which reflects the ability of the granular flow to expand or compress depends on the volume fraction pressure strain rate and inertial number in addition we require the dilatancy function to describe the rate of volume change of the granular material near an isochoric equilibrium state ie at constant volume this property ensures that the volume fraction which is the solution to the conservation of mass equation is positive and finite at all times we also require that the non isochoric fluidised model is linearly stable and dissipates energy over time in this theoretical framework we derive the dilatancy models corresponding to classical rheologies such as drucker prager and i with or without expansion effects the main result of this work is to show that it is possible to obtain non isochoric and fluidised granular models satisfying all the properties necessary to correctly account for the physics of granular flows and being well posed at least linearly stable\",\"this study first provides a brief overview of the structure of typical grassmann manifolds then a new type of supergrassmannians is construced using an odd involution in a super ringed space and by gluing superdomains together next constructing a gauss morphism of a super vector bundle some properties of this morphism is discussed by this we generalize one of the main theorems of homotopy classification for vector bundles in supergeometry afterwards a similar structure is introduced in the state of infinite dimensional here our tools

which converges in some weak sense to a limit space with some generalized notion of nonnegative scalar curvature the conjecture has been made precise at an ias emerging topics meeting requiring that the sequence be three dimensional with uniform upper bounds on diameter and volume and a positive uniform lower bound on mina which is the minimum area of a closed minimal surface in the manifold here we present a sequence of warped product manifolds with warped circles over standard spheres that have circular fibres over the poles whose length diverges to infinity that satisfy the hypotheses of this ias conjecture we prove this sequence converges in the sense for to an extreme limit space that has nonnegative scalar curvature in the distributional sense as defined by lee lefloch and that the total distributional scalar curvature converges this paper only requires expertise in smooth riemannian geometry smooth minimal surfaces and sobolev spaces in a second paper requiring expertise in metric geometry the first two authors prove intrinsic flat and gromov hausdorff convergence of our sequence to this extreme limit space and investigate its geometric properties\",\"flatness of discrete time systems can be characterized by two simple properties there exists a map a submersion from the flat coordinates and their forward shifts to the state and the input of the discrete time system such that the system equations are fulfilled identically flat coordinates together with their shifts also describe simple shift systems therefore this map transfers dynamic systems to dynamic systems based on these facts necessary conditions for a system to be flat are derived it is worth mentioning that methods from differential geometry are not required but these methods are used to derive algorithms for the test whether a system is flat or not and they are used to derive a flat parametrization\",\"we prove that any unitary highest weight module over a universal minimal quantum affine algebra at non critical level descends to its simple quotient we find the defining relations of the unitary simple minimal quantum affine algebras and the list of all their irreducible positive

many classes of smoluchowski type coagulation models can be realised as multiplicative grassmannian flows and are therefore linearisable and thus integrable in this sense first we prove that a general smoluchowski type equation with a constant frequency kernel that encompasses a large class of such models is realisable as a multiplicative grassmannian flow second we establish that several other related constant kernel models can also be realised as such these include the gallay mielke coarsening model the derrida retaux depinning transition model and a general mutliple merger coagulation model third we show how the additive and multiplicative frequency kernel cases can be realised as rank one analytic grassmannian flows\",\"standard perturbation theory of eigenvalue problems consists of obtaining approximations of eigenmodes in the neighborhood of a hamiltonian where the corresponding eigenmode is known nevertheless if the corresponding eigenmodes of several nearby hamiltonians are known standard perturbation theory cannot simultaneously use all this knowledge to provide a better approximation we derive a formula enabling such an approximation result and provide numerical examples for which this method is more competitive than standard perturbation theory\",\"the local generality of the space of solitons for the laplacian flow of closed structures is analyzed and it is shown that the germs of such structures depend up to diffeomorphism on functions of variables in the sense of e cartan the method is to construct a natural exterior differential system whose integral manifolds describe such solitons and to show that it is involutive in cartans sense so that cartan kahler theory can be applied meanwhile it turns out that for the more special case of gradient solitons the natural exterior differential system is not involutive and the generality of these structures remains a mystery\",\"we describe an algebraic chain level construction that models the passage from an arbitrary topological space to its free loop space the input of the construction is a categorical coalgebra ie a curved coalgebra satisfying certain properties and the output is a chain complex the construction is a modified version of the cohochschild complex of a differential graded dg coalgebra when applied to the chains on an arbitrary simplicial set  appropriately interpreted it yields a chain complex that is naturally quasi isomorphic to the singular chains on the free loop space of the geometric realization of  we relate this construction to a twisted tensor product model for the free loop space constructed using the adjoint action of a dg hopf algebra model for the based loop space\",\"let be a compact metric space and  we consider a set of admissible

quantum symmetric pair of affine type and an orientifold klr algebra arising from a framed quiver with a contravariant involution providing a boundary analogue of kang kashiwara kim oh generalized schur weyl duality with respect to their construction our combinatorial model is further enriched with the poles of a trigonometric k matrix intertwining the action of on finite dimensional modules by construction is naturally compatible with the kang kashiwara kim oh functor in that while the latter is a functor of monoidal categories is a functor of module categories relying on a suitable isomorphism a la brundan kleshchev rouquier we prove that recovers the schur weyl dualities due to fan lai li luo wang watanabe in quasi split type  we construct spectral k matrices for orientifold

product of representations of  specifically the product of a simple representation with a given abelian representation taken from the category of algebras we study the case in detail and we show that the product in this case recovers the expected structure our construction partially verifies a conjecture of rouquier from \",\"we study the local in time well posedness for an interface that separates an anisotropic plasma from a vacuum the plasma flow is governed by the ideal chew goldberger low cgl equations which are the simplest collisionless fluid model with anisotropic pressure the vacuum magnetic and electric fields are supposed to satisfy the pre maxwell equations the plasma and vacuum magnetic fields are tangential to the interface this represents a nonlinear hyperbolic elliptic coupled problem with a characteristic free boundary by a suitable symmetrization of the linearized cgl equations we reduce the linearized free boundary problem to a problem analogous to that

analysis that is the covariance matrix as a sequence of nested subspaces naturally coming with weights according to the level of approximation they provide we are able to embed all dimensional grassmannians into a stratified space of covariance matrices we observe that grassmannians constitute the lowest dimensional skeleton of the stratification while it is possible to define a riemaniann metric on the highest dimensional and dense stratum such a metric being compatible with the global stratification with such a riemaniann metric at hand it is possible to look for geodesics between two linear subspaces of different dimensions that do not go through higher dimensional linear subspaces as would euclidean geodesics building upon the proposed embedding of grassmannians into the stratified space of covariance matrices we generalize the concept of varifolds to what we call flagfolds in order to model multi dimensional shapes\",\"this paper contains an elementary proof of the existence of the classical model structure on the category of unbounded dg lie algebras over a field of characteristic zero with an emphasis on the properties of free and semifree extensions which are particularly nice cofibrations the cobar construction of a locally conilpotent cocommutative coalgebra is shown to be an example of semifree dg lie algebra we also give an example of a non cofibrant dg lie algebra whose underlying graded lie algebra is free this cannot occur in the bounded above case where dg lie algebras of this form are always cofibrant\",\"the main topic of this work concerns the formulation of the equations of motion and the consequent energy balance that they imply for this type of systems in particular the analytical development that we will carry out on the equations of motion has as its objective the energy balance of the system the delicate question of defining the displacements admitted by the system leads as we shall see to a non univocal definition of the

convex planar domains which are evolving by the minimal surface flow here we specify the angle of contact of the evolved surface to the boundary cylinder the interesting question is to find translating solitons of the form where  under an angle condition we can prove the a priori estimate holds true for the translating solitons ie translator which makes the solitons exist we can prove for suitable condition on that there is the global solution of the minimal surface flow then we show provided the soliton exists that the global solutions converge to some translator\",\"we show convergence of the gradients of the schrodinger potentials to the brenier map in the small time limit under general assumptions on the marginals which allow for unbounded densities and supports furthermore we provide novel quantitative stability estimates for the optimal values and optimal couplings for the schrodinger problem sp that we express in terms of a negative order weighted homogeneous sobolev norm the latter encodes the linearized behavior of the wasserstein distance between the marginals the proofs of both results highlight for the first time the relevance of gradient bounds for schrodinger potentials that we establish here in full generality in the analysis of the short time behavior of schrodinger bridges finally we discuss how our results translate into the framework of quadratic entropic optimal transport that is a version of sp more suitable for applications in machine learning and data science\",\"the divided powers depending on a parity form the

the pi degree using results of lenagan rigal and haynal to reduce the problem to finding properties of their associated matrices these matrices in turn correspond to cauchon le diagrams from which we can calculate the required matrix properties in particular we show that any matrix corresponding to an diagram has invariant factors which are powers of  our calculations allow us to state an explicit expression for the pi degree of quantum determinantal rings when the deformation parameter is a primitive root of unity with odd using this newly calculated pi degree we present a method to construct an irreducible representation of maximal dimension building on these results we use the strong connection between quantum determinantal rings and certain quantum schubert varieties through noncommutative dehomogenisation to obtain expressions for the pi degree of such quantum schubert varieties under the same conditions on \",\"we introduce quantum skein relations for a family of ribbon categories parametrised by the projective plane over  there are thirteen points for which the ribbon category admits a ribbon functor to a category of invariant tensors for a quantised enveloping algebra these thirteen points lie on three projective lines one line gives the first row of the freudenthal magic square and another gives the fourth row which is the exceptional series\",\"the biorthogonal formalism extends conventional quantum mechanics to the non hermitian realm it has however been pointed out that the biorthogonal inner product changes with the scaling of the eigenvectors an ambiguity whose physical significance is still being debated here we revisit this issue and argue when this choice of normalization is of physical importance we illustrate in which settings quantities such as expectation values and transition probabilities depend on the scaling of eigenvectors and in which settings the biorthogonal formalism remains unambiguous to resolve the apparent scaling ambiguity we introduce an inner product independent of the gauge choice of basis and show that its corresponding mathematical structure is consistent with quantum mechanics using this formalism we identify a deeper problem relating to the physicality of hilbert space representations which we illustrate using the position basis apart from increasing the understanding of the mathematical foundations upon which many physical results rely our findings also pave the way towards consistent comparisons between systems described by non hermitian hamiltonians\",\"the purpose of

cylindric diagram is described as a weak bruhat interval of the weyl group\",\"we study the family of irreducible modules for quantum affine whose drinfeld polynomials are supported on just one node of the dynkin diagram we identify all the prime modules in this family and prove a unique factorization theorem the drinfeld polynomials of the prime modules encode information coming from the points of reducibility of tensor products of the fundamental modules associated to with  these prime modules are a special class of the snake modules studied by mukhin and young we relate our modules to the work of hernandez and leclerc and define generalizations of the category  this leads naturally to the notion of an inflation of the corresponding grothendieck ring in the last section we show that the tensor product of a higher order kirillov reshetikhin module with its dual always contains an imaginary module in its jordan holder series and give an explicit formula for its drinfeld polynomial together with the results of this gives examples of a product of cluster variables which are not in the span of cluster monomials we also discuss the connection of our work with the examples arising

simplexes with regularity properties on both the low dimensional and high dimensional layers for low dimensions we request our simplexes to be horizontal while for high dimensions we define a notion of straight simplexes using exponential and logarithmic maps and we require our simplexes to have high dimensional straight layers a triangulation with such simplexes is first constructed on a general polyhedral structure and then extended to the whole heisenberg group in this paper we also provide some explicit examples of grid and triangulations\",\"in this paper we investigate the massive sine gordon model in the ultraviolet finite regime in thermal states over the two dimensional minkowski spacetime we combine recently developed methods of perturbative algebraic quantum field theory with techniques developed in the realm of constructive quantum field theory over euclidean spacetimes to construct the correlation functions of the equilibrium state of the sine gordon theory in the adiabatic limit first of all the observables of the sine gordon theory are seen as functionals over the free configurations and are obtained as a suitable combination of the s matrices of the interaction lagrangian restricted to compact spacetime regions over the free massive theory these s matrices are given as power series in the coupling constant with values in the algebra of fields over the free massive theory adapting techniques like conditioning and inverse conditioning to spacetimes with lorentzian signature we prove that these power series converge when evaluated on a generic field configuration the latter observation implies convergence in the strong operator topology in the gns representations of the considered states in the second part of the paper adapting the cluster expansion technique to the lorentzian case we prove that the correlation functions of the interacting equilibrium state at finite temperature kms state can be constructed also in the adiabatic

difference operators weight  in loday established the koszul duality for the operad of differential algebras of weight zero he did not treat the case of nonzero weight noting that new techniques are needed since the operad is no longer quadratic this paper continues lodays work and establishes the koszul duality in the case of nonzero weight in the process the minimal model and the koszul dual

complex as well as its algebra structure for differential algebras with weight are deduced\",\"given a pair of normally hyperbolic operators over possibily different globally hyperbolic spacetimes on a given smooth manifold the existence of a geometric isomorphism called em moller operator between the space of solutions is studied this is achieved by exploiting a new equivalence relation in the space of globally hyperbolic metrics called em paracausal relation in particular it is shown that the moller operator associated to a pair of paracausally related metrics and normally hyperbolic operators also intertwines the respective causal propagators of the normally hyperbolic operators and it preserves the natural symplectic forms on the space of smooth initial data finally the moller map is lifted to a isomorphism between generally off shell algebras it is shown that the wave front set of a hadamard bidistribution and of a hadamard state in particular is preserved by the pull back action of this isomorphism\",\"many connections and dualities in representation theory can be explained using quasi hereditary covers in the sense of rouquier the concepts of relative dominant and codominant dimension with respect to a module introduced recently by the first named author are important tools to evaluate and classify quasi hereditary covers in this paper we prove that the relative dominant dimension of the regular module of a quasi hereditary algebra with a simple preserving duality with respect to a summand of a characteristic tilting module equals twice the relative dominant dimension of a characteristic tilting module with respect to  to resolve the temperley lieb algebras of infinite global dimension we apply this result to the class of schur algebras and the tensor power of the dimensional module and we completely determine the relative dominant dimension of the schur algebra with respect to  the analogues of these results are also obtained as a byproduct we obtain a hemmer nakano type result connecting the ringel duals of schur algebras and temperley lieb algebras from the point of view of temperley lieb algebras we obtain the first complete classification of their connection to their quasi hereditary covers formed by ringel duals of schur algebras these results are compatible with the integral setup and we use them to deduce that the ringel dual of a schur algebra over the ring of laurent polynomials over the integers together with some projective module is the best quasi hereditary cover of the integral temperley lieb algebra\",\"semi classically equivalent field theories are related by a quasi isomorphism between their underlying algebras but such a quasi isomorphism is not necessarily a homotopy transfer we demonstrate that all quasi isomorphisms can be lifted to spans of algebras in which the quasi isomorphic algebras are obtained from a correspondence algebra by a homotopy transfer our construction is very useful homotopy transfer is computationally tractable and physically it amounts to integrating out fields in a feynman diagram expansion spans of algebras appear naturally in many contexts within physics as examples we first consider scalar field theory with interaction vertices blown up in different ways we then show that non abelian t duality can be seen as a span of algebras and we provide full details in the case of the principal chiral model we also present the relevant span of algebras for the penrose ward transform in the context of self dual yang mills theory and bogomolny monopoles\",\"for a finite dimensional simple lie algebra admitting a non trivial minuscule representation and a connected marked surface with at least two marked points and no punctures we prove that

laplacian coflow of a coclosed structure using the formulae for the irreducible decomposition of the hodge laplacian and the lie derivative of the hodge dual form of  in terms of this decomposition we characterise the conditions for a vector field as an infinitesimal symmetry of a coclosed structure as well as the soliton condition for the laplacian coflow more specifically we provide an easier proof for the absence of compact shrinking solitons of the laplacian coflow moreover we revisit the laplacian coflow of coclosed structures on almost abelian lie groups addressed by fino bagaglini  however our approach is based on the bracket flow point of view notably by showing that the norm of the lie bracket is strictly decreasing we prove that we have long time existence for any coclosed laplacian coflow solution\",\"the importance of the quantum fisher information metric is testified by the number of applications that this has in very different fields ranging from hypothesis testing to metrology passing through thermodynamics still from the rich range of possible quantum fisher information only a handful are typically used and studied this review aims at collecting a number of results scattered in the literature that can be useful to people who begin the study of fisher information and to those who are already working on it to have a more organic understanding of the topic moreover we complement the review with new results about the relation between fisher information and physical evolutions extending the study done in  we prove that all the physically realisable dynamics can be defined solely in terms of their relation with respect to the fisher information metric moreover other properties as markovianity retrodiction or detailed balance can be expressed in the same formalism these results show a fact that was partially overseen in the literature namely the inherently dynamical nature of fisher information\",\"we give a proof of lusztigs conjectural multiplicity formula for non restricted modules over the de concini kac type quantized enveloping algebra at the th root of unity where is an odd prime power satisfying certain reasonable conditions\",\"spontaneous stochasticity is a modern paradigm for turbulent transport at infinite reynolds numbers it suggests that tracer particles advected by rough turbulent flows and subject to additional thermal noise remain non deterministic in the limit where the random input namely the thermal noise vanishes here we investigate the fate of spontaneous stochasticity in the presence of spatial intermittency with multifractal scaling of the lognormal type as usually encountered in turbulence studies in principle multifractality enhances the underlying roughness and so should be the spontaneous stochasticity this letter exhibits a case with a lesser intuitive interplay between spontaneous stochasticity and spatial intermittency we specifically address lagrangian transport in uni dimensional multifractal random flows obtained by decorating rough markovian monofractal gaussian fields with frozen in time gaussian multiplicative chaos combining systematic monte carlo simulations and formal stochastic calculations we evidence a transition between spontaneously stochastic and deterministic behaviors when increasing the level of intermittency while its key ingredient in the gaussian setting here surprisingly roughness conspires against the spontaneous stochasticity of trajectories\",\"let be a field let be possibly disconnected reductive groups over  and let be a

establish a few apparently new results about integral models of reductive groups over discrete valuation rings\",\"we consider here a dynamic model for a gas in which a variable number of particles can be located at a site this point of view leads us to the grand canonical framework and the need for a chemical potential the dynamics is played by the shift acting on the set of sequences  where the alphabet is  introducing new variables like the number of particles and the chemical potential  we adapt the concept of grand canonical partition sum of thermodynamics of gases to a symbolic dynamical setting considering a lipschitz family of potentials   our main results will be obtained from adapting well known properties the results will be obtained through the use of known properties

theories and matrix models with manifest continuous gauge symmetries polynomial functions invariant under the manifest symmetries are the observables of interest and have applications in adscft we compute such correlators in the presence of matrix or tensor witnesses which by definition can include a matrix or tensor field appearing as a coupling in the action ie a spurion or as a classical un integrated field in the observables appearing alongside quantum integrated fields in both matrix and tensor cases we find that two point correlators of general gauge invariant observables can be written in terms of gauge invariant functions of the witness fields with coefficients given by structure constants of the associated pcas fourier transformation on the relevant pcas relates combinatorial bases to representation theoretic bases the representation theory basis elements obey orthogonality results for the two point correlators which generalise known orthogonality relations to the case with witness fields the new orthogonality equations involve two representation basis elements for observables as input and a representation basis observable constructed purely from witness

and an alternating metal ti stratified sphere to investigate how the topological magneto electric tme response of the ti sphere shells influences on the multipolar plasmonic resonance of the metal shells for these types the results show that the tme effect causes some modifications of the decay rate spectrum for an emitting dipole near a ti stratified sphere for the multipolar resonances of the metal shells it is observed that the tme induced red shifts for the bonding and lower order antibonding modes are found but those for the higher order antibonding modes are insignificant in addition for a metal coated ti sphere we take into account the effects of losses in the ti core of which the dielectric function is chosen to be the form of the bulk or five quintuple layers ql slab and then the some modifications of the tme induced decay rate spectrum are obviously suppressed these phenomenological characteristics provide useful guidance to probing the tme effect via molecular

or the two boundaries for cylinders for the general on loop model we show that these generating series satisfy functional relations obtained by a modification of those satisfied by the unrefined generating series in a more specific on model where loops cross only triangles and have a bending energy we explicitly compute the refined generating series we analyse their non generic critical behavior in the dense and dilute phases and obtain the large deviations function of the nesting distribution which is expected to be universal using the framework of liouville quantum gravity lqg we show that a rigorous functional kpz relation can be applied to the multifractal spectrum of extreme nesting in the conformal loop ensemble cle in the euclidean unit disk as obtained by miller watson

functions for general linear groups from two very different sources from iwahori fixed vectors and from metaplectic covers interpolating between them by drinfeld twisting we uncover unexpected relationships between iwahori and metaplectic whittaker functions this leads to new demazure operator recurrence relations for spherical metaplectic whittaker functions in prior work of the authors it was shown that the row transfer matrices of certain lattice models for spherical metaplectic whittaker functions could be represented as half vertex operators operating on the fock space of kashiwara

dades group  which relates   and group cohomology\",\"topological invariants such as winding numbers and linking numbers appear as charges of topological solitons in diverse nonlinear physical systems described by a unit vector field defined on two and three dimensional manifolds while the gauss bonnet theorem shows that the euler characteristic a topological invariant can be written as the integral of the gaussian curvature an intrinsic geometric quantity the intriguing question of whether winding and linking numbers can also be expressed similarly as integrals of some intrinsic geometric quantities has not been addressed in the literature in this paper we provide the answer by showing that for the winding number in two dimensions these quantities are torsions of the two evolving space curves describing the manifold on the other hand in three dimensions we find that in addition to torsions intrinsic twists of the space curves are necessary to obtain a nontrivial winding number and linking number these new results arise from the hitherto unknown connections that we establish between these topological invariants and the corresponding appropriately normalized

moody algebras in its most basic form convolution between two quiver varieties is given by pullback and then pushforward via the hecke correspondence for quivers in previous work we showed that the hecke correspondence has a morse theoretic interpretation in terms of spaces of flow lines the goal of this paper is to show that the topological information that defines generators for nakajimas representations can be encoded in the cup product for a morse complex defined on the smooth space of representations of a quiver without relations and then pulling back to the subvariety of

example handsaw quivers for the norm square of a moment map on the space of representations of a quiver the usual morse bott smale transversality condition on the space of flow lines fails however a weaker version of transversality is still satisfied a major part of the paper is spent developing a general theory in this setting of weak transversality from which one can recover the usual

examples such as quantum adiabatic computation the grover algorithm and the shor algorithm we demonstrate how the entanglement trajectory remains within the boundaries that we have established generating a unique feature for each example furthermore we demonstrate that these boundaries and features can be extended to trajectories defined by other measures of entanglement numerical simulations are available through open access\",\"swarming phenomena are ubiquitous in various physical biological and social systems where simple local interactions between individual units lead to complex global patterns a common feature of diverse swarming phenomena is that the units exhibit either convergent or divergent evolution in their behaviors ie becoming increasingly similar or distinct respectively the associated dynamics changes across time leading to complex consequences on a global scale in this study we propose a generalized laplacian dynamics model to describe both convergent and divergent swarm behaviors where the trends of convergence and divergence compete with each other and jointly determine the evolution of global patterns we empirically observe non

left duals of objects in the module category are given by internal homs and cohoms respectively we express the double duals in terms of relative serre functors which leads to a radford isomorphism for module categories there is a bicategorical version of the radford theorem on the bicategory of a morita context the relative serre functors assemble into a pseudo functor and the radford isomorphisms furnish a trivialization of the square of this pseudo functor ie of the fourth power of the duals we also show that the morita bicategories coming from pivotal exact module categories are pivotal as bicategories leading to the notion of pivotal morita equivalence this equivalence of tensor categories amounts to the equivalence of their bicategories of pivotal module categories furthermore we

zeitlin model is a finite dimensional analog of the d euler equations the only known discretization that preserves the rich geometric structure theoretical and numerical studies indicate that zeitlins model provides consistent long time behaviour on large scales but to which extent it truly reflects the euler equations is mainly open towards progress we give here two results first convergence of the sectional curvature in the euler zeitlin equations on the lie algebra to that of the euler equations on the sphere second convergence of the corresponding jacobi equations for lagrangian and eulerian stability the results allow geometric conclusions about zeitlins model to be transferred to eulers equations and vice versa which might be central in the ultimate aim to characterize the

branched minimal immersion are first or second eigenfunctions with respect to a natural metric on the sphere involved in this problem called critical metric then it is an embedding into a dimensional ellipsoid or an immersion into a dimensional ellipsoid if in addition this critical metric is rotationally symmetric with respect to an axis and symmetric with respect to the orthogonal plane then the immersion is an embedding we also give a construction of non planar minimal spheres into dimensional ellipsoids such that the coordinate functions are first and second eigenfunctions with respect to

fluid advection can arrest the singularity formation given that the fluid flow possesses mixing or diffusion enhancing properties and its amplitude is sufficiently strong this effect is conjectured to hold for more general classes of nonlinear pdes in this paper we consider the patlak keller segel equation coupled with a fluid flow that obeys darcys law for incompressible porous media via buoyancy

be understood in a simple way in our approach in particular the energy transfer between radiation translation and shape modes is carefully investigated in the single kink sector finally we also discuss the inclusion of radiation modes in the study of oscillons this leads to relevant phenomena such as the oscillon decay and the kink antikink creation\",\"demazure crystals are subcrystals of highest weight irreducible crystals in this article we study tensor products of a larger class of subcrystals called extremal and give a local characterization for exactly when the tensor product of demazure crystals is extremal we then show that tensor products of demazure crystals decompose into direct sums of demazure crystals if and only if the tensor product is extremal thus providing a

physical assumption in the study of topologically ordered systems and it is a central axiom of mathematical frameworks of topological quantum field theories we show under the entanglement bootstrap approach that remote detectability is a necessary property that is we derive it as a theorem starting from a single wave function on a topologically trivial region satisfying the entanglement bootstrap axioms we can construct states on closed manifolds the crucial technique is to immerse the punctured manifold into the topologically trivial region and then heal the puncture this is analogous to kirbys torus trick we then analyze a special class of such manifolds which we call pairing manifolds for each pairing manifold which pairs two classes of excitations we identify an analog of the topological s matrix this pairing matrix is unitary which implies remote detectability between two classes of excitations these matrices are in general not associated with the mapping class

give rise to lower order supermultiplets\",\"long term predictions of nonlinear dynamics of three dimensional d turbulence are very challenging for machine learning approaches in this paper we propose an implicit u net enhanced fourier neural operator iu fno for stable and efficient predictions on the long term large scale dynamics of turbulence the iu fno model employs implicit recurrent fourier

natural flow is directly related to the critical exponent of the fundamental group there are several applications of the natural flow that connect dynamical geometrical and topological invariants of the manifold first we give dimensional linear isoperimetric inequalities when  this in turn produces lower bounds on the cheeger constant we resolve a recent conjecture of dey kapovich on the non existence of dimensional compact complex subvarieties of complex hyperbolic manifolds with  we also provide upper bounds on the homological dimension generalizing work of kapovich and work of farb with the first two authors using different methods we also give upper bounds on the cohomological dimension which partially resolves a conjecture of kapovich we also specialize to the setting of

priori estimate for a general class of form fully nonlinear partial differential equations on compact hermitian manifolds our method relies on the local version of comparison with auxiliary monge ampere equations developed earlier by b guo and d h phong the key is to find the appropriate elliptic operator such that the maximum principle applies\",\"in this paper we develop the perfect basis theory for quantum borcherds bozec algebras and their irreducible highest weight modules  we show that the perfect graph resp dual perfect graph of every perfect basis resp dual perfect basis of resp  is isomorphic to resp  for this purpose we define a new class of kashiwara operators which is different from the one given by bozec and prove all the interlocking inductive statements in kashiwaras grand loop argument which shows the existence and the uniqueness of crystal bases for quantum borcherds bozec algebras\",\"in this paper we prove that the stokes matrices of certain universal meromorphic linear system of ordinary differential equations of poncare rank one give rise to a family of representations of quantum group  we then apply the representation theory of quantum groups to get algebraic understanding of some analysis problems in particular motivated by the theory of canonical basis and representations at roots of unity we give conjectural characterizations of the wkb approximation and soliton solutions of the meromorphic differential equations respectively along the way we point out that the asymptotic expansion of stokes matrices obtained in our previous work gives rise to an explicit drinfeld isomorphism\",\"motivated by the study of relativistic atoms we consider the hardy operator acting on functions of the form in  when and  we give a ground state representation of the corresponding form on the half line theorem  for the proof we use subordinated bessel heat kernels\",\"modular functors are traditionally defined as systems of projective representations of mapping class groups of surfaces that are compatible with gluing they can formally be described as modular algebras over central extensions of the modular surface operad with the values of the algebra lying in a suitable symmetric monoidal category of linear categories in this paper we prove that modular functors in are equivalent to self dual balanced braided algebras in a categorification of the notion of a commutative frobenius algebra for which a condition formulated in terms of factorization homology with coefficients in is satisfied we call such connected the equivalence in one direction is afforded by genus zero restriction our construction of the inverse equivalence is entirely topological and can be thought of as a far reaching generalization of the construction of modular functors from skein theory in order to verify the connectedness condition in practice we prove that cofactorizability of  a condition known to be satisfied for modular categories is sufficient therefore we recover in particular lyubashenkos construction of a modular functor from a not necessarily semisimple modular category and show that it is determined by its genus zero part additionally we exhibit modular functors that do not come from modular categories and outline applications to the theory of vertex operator algebras\",\"it was recently shown by the second author and diaz garcia krutov somberg and strung that every relative line module over an irreducible quantum flag manifold admits a unique covariant connection with respect to the heckenberger kolb differential calculus  in this paper we show that these connections are bimodule connections with an invertible associated bimodule map this is proved by applying general results of beggs and majid on principal connections for quantum principal bundles to the quantum principal bundle presentation of the heckenberger kolb calculi recently constructed by the authors and diaz garcia explicit presentations of the associated bimodule maps are given first in terms of generalised quantum determinants then in terms of the frt presentation of the algebra  and finally in terms of takeuchis

over a sphere an example of such a map is the well known birkhoff billiard map corresponding to smooth convex hypersurfaces in this work we will focus on the important class of orbits of which are locally maximizing with respect to the variational principle associated with a generating function of the symplectic twist map our first goal is to give geometric and variational characterization for orbits in the class  the billiard map is known to have two different generating functions which brings forth a natural question to compare the properties of these two generating functions while our motivation comes from billiards we will work in general and assume that a general twist map has two generating functions thus we consider the orbits of which are locally maximizing with respect to either of the generating functions we formulate a geometric criterion that guarantees that two generating functions of the same twist map have the same class of locally maximizing orbits and we will show that the two generating functions for the birkhoff billiard map do in fact satisfy this criterion the proof of this last property will rely on the sinai chernov formula from geometric optics and billiard dynamics\",\"we introduce manifold tensor categories which make precise the notion of a tensor category with a manifold of simple objects a basic example is the category of vector spaces

manifold tensor categories and a generalisation we term orbifold tensor categories we also construct a number of examples most notably two families of examples we call interpolated tambara yamagami categories and interpolated quantum group categories finally we show conditions under which pointwise duality data in an orbifold tensor category automatically assembles into smooth duality data our proof uses the classic implicit function theorem from differential geometry\",\"let be a function defined on a connected open subset  we will show that its graph is contained in a quadratic surface if and only if is a weak solution to a certain system of nth order partial differential equations unless the hessian determinant of is non positive on the whole  moreover we will prove that the system is in some sense the simplest possible in a wide class of differential equations which will lead to the classification of all polynomial partial differential equations satisfied by parametrizations of generic quadratic surfaces although we will mainly use the tools of linear and commutative algebra the theorem itself is also somehow related to holomorphic functions\",\"we obtain fredholm type formulas for partial degenerations of theta functions on irreducible nodal curves of arbitrary genus with emphasis on nodal curves of genus one an application is the study of many soliton solutions on an elliptic cnoidal background standing wave for the korteweg de vries kdv equation starting from a formula that is reminiscent of the classical kay moses formula for solitons in particular we represent such a solution as a sum of the following two terms a shifted elliptic cnoidal background wave and a kay moses type determinant containing jacobi theta functions for the solitonic content which can be viewed as a collection of solitary disturbances on the cnoidal background the expressions for the traveling group speed of these solitary disturbances as well as for the interaction kernel describing the scattering of pairs of such solitary disturbances are obtained explicitly in terms of jacobi theta functions we also show that genus finite gap solutions with random initial phases converge in probability to the deterministic cnoidal wave solution as bands degenerate to a nodal curve of genus one finally we derive the nonlinear dispersion relations and the equation of states for the kdv soliton gas on the residual elliptic background\",\"in this work we revisit the krein rutman theory for semigroups of positive operators in a banach lattice framework and we provide

definite function on the free group and our primary goal is to understand how such functions can be extended from balls of finite radius to the entire group previous work showed that such extensions always exist and we study the problem of simultaneous extension of multiple positive definite functions more specifically we define a concept of relative energy which measures the proximity between a pair of positive definite functions and show that a pair of positive definite functions on a finite ball can be extended to the entire group without increasing their relative energy the proof is analytic involving differentiation of noncommutative szego parameters\",\"this paper consists of four parts it begins by using the authorss generalized schauder formula  and the algebraic multiplicity  of esquinas and lopez gomez  to package and sharpening all existing results in local and global bifurcation theory for fredholm operators through the recent authors axiomatization of the fitzpatrick pejsachowicz rabier degree  this facilitates reformulating and refining all existing results in a compact and unifying way then the local structure of the solution set of analytic nonlinearities at a simple degenerate eigenvalue is ascertained by means of some concepts and devices of algebraic geometry and galois theory which establishes a bisociation between bifurcation theory and algebraic geometry finally the unilateral theorems of  as well as the refinement of xi and wang  are substantially generalized this paper also analyzes two important examples to illustrate and discuss the relevance of the abstract theory the second one studies the regular positive solutions of a multidimensional quasilinear boundary value problem of mixed type related to the mean curvature operator\",\"we study the deformation complex of the standard morphism from the degree shifted lie operad to its polydifferential version and prove that it is quasi isomorphic to the kontsevich graph complex  in particular we show that in the case the grothendieck teichmuller group is a symmetry group up to homotopy of the aforementioned morphism we also prove that in the case corresponding to the usual lie algebras the standard morphism admits a unique homotopy non trivial deformation which is described explicitly with the help of the universal enveloping construction finally we prove the rigidity of the strongly homotopy version of the universal enveloping functor in the lie theory\",\"the topic of measurement in relativistic quantum field theory is addressed in this article some of the long standing problems of this subject are highlighted including the incompatibility of an instantaneous collapse of the wavefunction with relativity of simultaneity and the difficulty of maintaining causality in the rules for measurement highlighted by impossible measurement scenarios thereafter the issue is considered from the perspective of mathematical physics to this end quantum field theory is described in a model independent operator algebraic setting on generic lorentzian spacetime manifolds the process of measurement is modelled by a localized dynamical coupling between a quantum field called the system and another quantum field called the probe the result of the dynamical coupling is a scattering map whereby measurements carried out on the probe can be interpreted as measurements of induced observables on the system the localization of the dynamical coupling allows it to derive causal relations for the induced observables it will be discussed how this approach leads to the concept of selective or non selective system state updates conditioned on the result of probe measurements which in turn allows it to obtain conditional probabilities for consecutive probe measurements consistent with relativistic causality and general covariance without the need for a physical collapse of the wavefunction in particular the problem of impossible measurements is resolved finally there is a brief discussion of accelerated detectors and other related work\",\"noethers theorem on the equivalence of symmetry and conservation laws has applications to geometric

arbitrary graded lie groups more precisely to any finite borel measure with compact support on a graded lie group we associate the corresponding dyadic maximal function using the homogeneous structure of the group then we prove a criterion in terms of the order at zero and at infinity of the group fourier transform of with respect to a fixed rockland operator on that assures the boundedness of on

newtonian theory ensures the existence of the its law of motion on shape space to deduce the equations of motion for a systems shape degrees of freedom from its evolution equations for the absolute configuration degrees of freedom the boltzman hamel equations of motion in an non holonomic frame on the tangent space to the systems absolute configuration space is adapted to the fiber bundle structure of the configuration space the derived equations of motion on shape space enable us among other things to predict the evolution of the shape of a classical system governed by this theory without any reference to its absolute position orientation or size in space the paper will explain that by treating the measuring instruments as part of the matter in the theory how the mass metric on the configuration space uniquely defines a metric on the reduced tangent bundle  and how the unique metric structure on shape space can be derived after deriving the reduced equations of motion on shape space for a general body system the shape equations of motion for a three body system in suitable coordinates is given as an illustration\",\"we first review the theory of integral currents in metric spaces due to ambrosio kirchheim and others and the barycenter map method developed by besson courtois gallot in their work on the entropy rigidity problem we then apply those elements to the

the present work the car algebra is used to describe fermionic degrees of freedom in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory the states for which the relative entropy is investigated are multi excitation states similar to multi particle states with respect to kms states defined with respect to a time evolution induced by a unitary dynamical group on the one particle hilbert space of the car algebra if the kms state is quasifree the relative entropy of multi excitation states can be explicitly calculated in terms of point functions which are defined entirely by the one particle hilbert space defining the car algebra and the hamilton operator of the dynamical group on the one particle hilbert space this applies also in the case that the one particle hilbert space hamilton operator has a continuous spectrum so that the relative entropy of multi excitation states cannot be defined in terms of von neumann entropies the results obtained here for the relative entropy of multi excitation states on the car algebra can be viewed as counterparts of results for the relative entropy of coherent states on the algebra of canonical commutation relations ccr which have appeared

the metric under certain conditions rather than a single metric we allow two distinct metrics in between the interfaces enabling the consideration of two wave types like p and s polarized waves in isotropic elastic solids terrestrial planets in our solar system are approximately spherically symmetric and support toroidal and spheroidal modes discontinuities typically correspond with phase transitions in their interiors our rigidity result applies to such planets as we ensure that our conditions are satisfied in generally accepted models in the presence of a fluid outer core the proof

precisely based on the recent work given by aizenbud and lapid we give a description of extension groups of a preprojective algebra in terms of the ar translation and nilpotent matrices as a result we calculate the extension group of a sort of so called determinantal modules which is an analogue of quantum minors in quantum coordinate rings in particular we give an equivalent combinatorial condition when the product of two quantum minors up to power rescaling belongs to the dual canonical basis of quantum coordinate rings in the dynkin case more generally we can check the quasicommuting

majumdar papapetrou metric which might be useful\",\"the paper presents a two scale model of periodic porous piezoelectric structures saturated by a newtonian fluid the fluid flow is propelled by peristaltic deformation of the microchannels which is induced due to locally controllable piezoelectric segments actuated by propagating voltage waves the homogenization method is employed to derive the limit macroscopic model of a poroelastic medium with the effective parameters modified due the piezoelectric properties of the skeleton to capture the peristaltic pumping effect the nonlinearity associated with the deforming configuration must be respected in the homogenized linear model this nonlinearity is introduced by deformation dependent homogenized coefficients of the macroscopic equations for this a linear expansions based on the sensitivity analysis of the homogenized coefficients with respect to the deformation induced by the macroscopic quantities is employed this enables to avoid the two scale tight coupling of the macro and microproblems otherwise needed when nonlinear problems are considered the derived model is implemented and verified using direct numerical simulations of the periodic heterogeneous medium numerical results demonstrate the peristaltic driven fluid propulsion in response to the electric actuation and the efficiency of the proposed

group of order \",\"we present a systematic recipe for generating and classifying duality transformations in one dimensional quantum lattice systems our construction emphasizes the role of global symmetries including those described by non abelian groups but also more general categorical symmetries these symmetries can be realized as matrix product operators which allow the extraction of a fusion category that characterizes the algebra of all symmetric operators commuting with the symmetry known as the bond algebra its explicit realizations are classified by module categories over the fusion category a duality is then defined by a pair of distinct module categories giving rise to dual realizations of the bond algebra as well as dual hamiltonians symmetries of dual models are in general distinct but satisfy a categorical morita equivalence a key novelty of our categorical approach is the explicit construction of matrix product operators that intertwine dual bond algebra realizations at the level of the hilbert space and in general map local order operators to non local string order operators we illustrate this approach for known dualities such as kramers wannier jordan wigner kennedy tasaki and the irf vertex correspondence a new duality of the chain model and dualities in models with the exotic haagerup symmetry finally we comment on generalizations to higher dimensions\",\"we discuss a two parameter renormalization group rg flow when parameters are organized in a single complex variable  with modular properties throughout the work we consider a special limit when the imaginary part of characterizing the disorder strength tends to zero we argue that generalized riemann thomae grt function and the corresponding generalized devils staircase

forms after chern to compute a family of formulas for comparing total mean curvatures of nested hypersurfaces in riemannian manifolds this yields a quicker proof of a recent result of the author with joel spruck which had been obtained via reillys identities\",\"differential geometric approaches to the analysis and processing of data in the form of symmetric positive definite spd matrices have had notable successful applications to numerous fields including computer vision medical imaging and machine learning the dominant geometric paradigm for such applications has consisted of a few riemannian geometries associated with spectral computations that are costly at high scale and in high dimensions we present a route to a scalable geometric framework for the analysis and processing of spd valued data based on the efficient computation of extreme generalized eigenvalues through the hilbert and thompson geometries of the semidefinite cone we explore a particular geodesic space structure based on thompson geometry in detail and establish several properties associated with this structure furthermore we define a novel iterative mean of spd matrices based on this geometry and prove its existence and uniqueness for a given finite collection of points finally we state and prove a number of desirable properties that are satisfied by this mean\",\"we study metric teleparallel geometries which can either be defined through a lorentzian metric and flat metric compatible affine connection or a tetrad and a flat spin connection which are invariant under the transitive action of a four dimensional lie group on their spatial equal time hypersurfaces there are three such group actions and their corresponding spatial hypersurfaces belong to the bianchi types ii iii and ix respectively for each of these three symmetry groups we determine the most general teleparallel geometry and find that it is parametrized by six functions of time one of which can be eliminated by the choice of the time coordinate we further show that these geometries are unique up to global lorentz transformations coordinate transformations and changes of the choice of the parameter

variables such as velocity and rate of strain as intensive vector valued forms while kinetics variables such as stress and momentum as extensive covector valued pseudo forms we treat the spatial material and convective representations of the motion and show how to geometrically convert from one representation to the other furthermore we show the equivalence of our exterior calculus formulation to standard formulations in the literature based on tensor calculus in addition we highlight two types of structures underlying the theory first the principle bundle structure relating the space of embeddings to the space of riemannian metrics on the body and how the latter represents an intrinsic space of deformations second the de rham complex structure relating the spaces of bundle

deformation theory and many other areas of mathematics unfortunately this construction only works over a field of characteristic  the goal of this paper is to show that the notions of maurer cartan

the twisted convolution algebra of the geometric quantization of a lie groupoid one which integrates the poisson structure we show that there is an analogue of the poisson sigma model which is valued in lie groupoids and which can often be defined non perturbatively it can be obtained by symplectic reduction using the quantization of the lie groupoid we call these groupoid valued sigma models and we argue that when they exist they can be used to compute correlation functions of gauge invariant observables this leads to a possibly non associative product on the underlying space of functions on the poisson manifold and in several examples we show that we recover strict deformation quantizations in the sense of rieffel even in the cases when our construction leads to a non associative product we still obtain a algebra and a quantization map in particular we construct noncommutative algebras equipped with an action together with an equivariant quantization map from no polarizations are used in the construction of these algebras\",\"we show that the hodge filtration of a tempered hodge module is generated by the lowest piece of its hodge filtration as a consequence we prove the main conjecture of sv in the special case of tempered representations of real reductive lie groups\",\"we introduce a variant of the theoretic quantized coulomb branch constructed by braverman finkelberg nakajima by application of a new virtual intersection theory in the abelian case we define verma modules for such virtual coulomb branches and relate them to the moduli spaces of quasimaps into the corresponding higgs branches the descendent vertex functions defined by theoretic quasimap invariants of the higgs branch can be realized as the associated whittaker functions the quantum difference modules and bethe algebras analogue of quantum theory rings can then be described in terms of the virtual coulomb branch as an application we prove the wall crossing result for quantum difference

first part of this phd thesis focuses at establishing the schauder estimates a useful analytical tool to prove also the well posedness of stochastic differential equations sdes for two different classes of kolmogorov equations under a weak hormander like condition whose coefficients lie in suitable anisotropic holder spaces with multi indices of regularity the first class considers a nonlinear system controlled by a symmetric stable operator acting only on some components our method of proof relies on a perturbative approach based on forward parametrix expansions through duhamel type formulas due to the low regularizing properties given by the degenerate setting we also exploit some controls on besov norms in order to deal with the non linear perturbation as an extension of the first one we also present schauder estimates associated with a degenerate ornstein uhlenbeck operator driven by a larger class of stable like operators like the relativistic or the lamperti stable one exploiting a backward parametrix approach the second part of this work aims at establishing the weak well posedness for a degenerate chain of sdes driven by the same class of stable like processes under the assumptions of the minimal holder regularity on the coefficients as a by product of our method we also present krylov type estimates of independent interest for the associated canonical process finally we show through suitable counter examples the existence of an almost sharp threshold on the regularity exponents ensuring the weak well posedness for the sde in connection with some possible applications to kinetic dynamics with friction we conclude by investigating the stability of second order perturbations for degenerate kolmogorov operators in lp and holder norms\",\"we prove

the multivariate setting of manzel and schurmann covering eg voiculescus bifreeness as well as bozejko and speichers c free independence at the same time we free the proof in the univariate situation from its dependence on murakis classification theorem which states that there are only five univariate independences tensor free boolean monotone and antimonotone independence in contrast to the univariate case the class of multivariate independences considered here is infinite and not yet fully understood furthermore helpful tools such quantum stochastic calculi and fock space constructions which are used by schurmann and voss to prove schoenberg correspondence in the univariate case are not available in general this problem is overcome by relating convolution exponentials with respect to different independences to each other which ultimately allows to reduce all schoenberg correspondences for multivariate independences to the case of convolution semigroups on  bialgebras\",\"a fundamental problem in quantum engineering is determining the lowest time required to ensure that all possible unitaries can be generated with the tools available which is one of a number of possible quantum speed limits we examine this problem from the perspective of quantum control where the system of interest is described by a drift hamiltonian and set of control hamiltonians our approach uses a combination of lie algebra theory lie groups and differential geometry and formulates the problem in terms of geodesics on a differentiable manifold we provide explicit lower bounds on the quantum speed limit for the case of an arbitrary drift requiring only that the control hamiltonians generate a topologically closed subgroup of the full unitary group and formulate criteria as to when our expression for the speed limit is exact and not merely a lower bound these analytic results are then tested and confirmed using a numerical optimization scheme finally we extend the analysis to find a lower bound on the quantum speed limit in the common case where the system is described by a drift hamiltonian and a single control hamiltonian\",\"we analyze the cauchy problem for the proca equation in gravitating dielectric media\",\"the deligne langlands correspondence parametrizes irreducible representations of the affine hecke algebra by certain perverse sheaves we show that this can be lifted to an equivalence of triangulated categories more precisely we construct for each central character of an equivalence of triangulated categories between a perfect derived category of dg modules

known result of garnett and jones for the classical space introduced by john and nirenberg as an application we show that a function with compact support can be decomposed as the summation of an function and the integral of the heat kernel associated with  against a finite carleson measure on  the key new technique is a geometric construction involving the semigroup  we also resort to several fundamental tools including the stopping time argument and the random dyadic lattice\",\"we use combinatorics of characters to study extensions of deformed algebras we describe additional currents and

entanglement and the breakthrough on the cap set problem strassens asymptotic spectra program focs  characterizes optimal matrix multiplication algorithms through monotone functionals our work advances and makes novel connections among two recent developments in the study of tensors namely the slice rank of tensors a notion of rank for tensors that emerged from the resolution of the cap set problem ann of math  and the quantum functionals of tensors stoc  monotone functionals defined as optimizations over moment polytopes more precisely we introduce an extension of slice rank that we call weighted slice rank and we develop a minimax correspondence between the asymptotic weighted slice rank and the quantum functionals weighted slice rank encapsulates different notions of bipartiteness of quantum entanglement the correspondence allows us to give a rank type characterization of the quantum functionals moreover whereas the original definition of the quantum functionals only works over the complex numbers this new characterization can be extended to all fields thereby in addition to gaining deeper understanding of strassens theory for the complex numbers we obtain a proposal for quantum functionals over other fields the finite field case is crucial for combinatorial and algorithmic problems where the field can be optimized over\",\"discrete subfactors include a particular class of infinite index subfactors and all finite index ones a discrete subfactor is called local when it is braided and it fulfills a commutativity condition motivated by the study of inclusion of quantum field theories in the algebraic haag kastler setting in bdg we proved that every irreducible local discrete subfactor arises as the fixed point subfactor under the action of a canonical compact hypergroup in this work we prove a galois correspondence between intermediate von neumann algebras and closed subhypergroups and we study the subfactor theoretical fourier transform in this context along the way we extend the main results concerning induction and restriction for braided subfactors previously known in the finite index case\",\"we prove quantitative unique continuation estimates for relatively dense sets and spectral subspaces associated to small energies of schrodinger operators on riemannian manifolds with ricci curvature bounded below the upper bound

adic group and let repgs be a bernstein block in the category of smooth complex g representations we investigate the structure of repgs by analysing the algebra of g endomorphisms of a progenerator pi of that category we show that repgs is almost morita equivalent with a twisted affine hecke algebra this statement is made precise in several ways most importantly with a family of twisted graded algebras it entails that as far as finite length representations are concerned repgs and endg pi mod can be treated as the module category of a twisted affine hecke algebra we draw two consequences firstly we show that the equivalence of categories between repgs and endg pi mod preserves temperedness of finite length representations secondly we provide a classification of the irreducible representations in repgs in terms of the complex torus and the finite group canonically associated to repgs this proves a version of the abps conjecture and enables us to express the set of

prescribed total curvature equal to  if and only if and prove that such solutions remain compact as  while they produce a spherical blow up as \",\"we present a nonlinear geometrically exact and thermodynamically consistent framework for modeling special cosserat rods with evolving natural configurations in contrast to the common usage of the point wise clausius duhem inequality to embody the second law of thermodynamics we enforce the strictly weaker form that the rate of total entropy production is non decreasing the constitutive relations between the state variables and applied forces needed to close the governing field equations are derived via prescribing frame indifferent forms of the helmholtz energy and the total dissipation rate and requiring that the state variables evolve in a way that maximizes the rate of total entropy production due to the flexibility afforded by enforcing a global form of the second law there are two models obtained from this procedure one satisfying the stronger form of the clausius duhem inequality and one satisfying the weaker global form of the clausius duhem inequality finally we show that in contrast to other viscoelastic cosserat rod models introduced in the past certain quadratic strain energies in our model yield both solid like stress relaxation and creep\",\"based on very recent and promising ideas stemming from the use of bubbles we discuss an algorithm for the numerical simulation of the cubic nonlinear schrodinger equation with harmonic potential cnls in any dimension that could easily be extended to other polynomial nonlinearities this algorithm consists in discretizing the initial function as a sum of modulated complex gaussian functions the bubbles each one having its own set of parameters and then updating the parameters according to cnls numerically we solve exactly the linear part of the equation and use the dirac frenkel maclachlan principle to approximate the nonlinear part we then obtain a grid free algorithm in any dimension whose efficiency compared with spectral methods is illustrated by numerical examples\",\"we adapt glimms approximation method to the framework of convex integration to show

groups is isomorphic to that of the symmetric groups in a range of degrees that increases with the number of nodes furthermore we show that when the defining parameter of the partition algebra is invertible then the homology of the partition algebra is in fact isomorphic to the homology of the symmetric group in all degrees these results parallel those obtained for the brauer algebras in the authors earlier work but with significant differences and difficulties in the inductive resolution and high acyclicity arguments required to prove them our results join the growing literature on

on the moduli space of two centred hyperbolic monopoles by working in the point particle approximation that is treating well separated monopoles as point particles with an electric magnetic and scalar charge and re interpreting the dynamics of the particle system as geodesic motion with respect to some metric the corresponding analysis in the euclidean case famously yields the negative mass taub nut metric which asymptotically approximates the metric on the moduli space of two euclidean monopoles the atiyah hitchin metric an important difference with the euclidean case is that due to the absence of galilean symmetry in the hyperbolic case it is not possible to factor out the centre of mass motion nevertheless we show that we can consistently restrict to a dimensional configuration space by considering antipodal configurations in complete parallel with the euclidean case the metric that we obtain is then the hyperbolic analogue of negative mass taub nut we also show how the metric obtained is related to the asymptotic form of a hyperbolic analogue of the atiyah hitchin metric constructed by hitchin\",\"the trigonometric double affine hecke algebra for an irreducible root

instance in the operator or hilbert schmidt norm topologies this system presents remarkable ellipticity properties that turn out to be crucial for the study of the infinite time limit of its solution which is proven under relatively weak albeit probably not necessary hypotheses on the initial data this system of differential equations is the elliptic counterpart of an hyperbolic flow applied to quantum field theory to diagonalize hamiltonians that are quadratic in the bosonic field in a similar way this elliptic flow in particular its asymptotics has application in quantum field theory it can be used to diagonalize hamiltonians that are quadratic in the fermionic field while giving new explicit expressions and properties of these pivotal hamiltonians of quantum field theory and quantum statistical mechanics\",\"this work is the first in a series of papers that among other things extends the formalism of diolic differential calculus wherein a new context for obtaining differential calculus in vector bundles was established here we provide a modest but interesting generalization of this formalism to include a class of vector bundles with additional inner structure provided by fiber metrics that we call triole algebras we discuss the basics of a triolic linear algebra and study various functors of differential calculus over these algebraic objects in doing so we establish a conceptual framework for making sense of calculus on bundles that preserve a vector valued fiber metric structure\",\"we develop a thom mather theory of frontals analogous to ishikawas theory of deformations of legendrian singularities but at the frontal level avoiding the use of the contact setting in particular we define concepts like frontal stability versality of frontal unfoldings or frontal codimension we prove several characterizations of stability including a frontal mather gaffney criterion and of versality we then define the method of reduction with which we show how to construct frontal versal unfoldings of plane curves and show how to construct stable unfoldings of corank frontals with isolated instability which are not necessarily versal we prove a frontal version

quantum differential equation of the cotangent bundle of a grassmannian in terms of the equivariant k theory algebra of the cotangent bundle this description is based on the hypergeometric integral representations for solutions of the equivariant quantum differential equation we identify the space of solutions with the space of the equivariant k theory algebra of the cotangent bundle in particular we show that for any element of the monodromy group all entries of its matrix in the standard basis of the equivariant k theory algebra of the cotangent bundle are laurent polynomials with integer coefficients in the exponentiated equivariant parameters\",\"this note consists of two parts the first part s and s  is a partial review of the works by van meer and stokman  van meer  and stokman  which established a bispectral analogue of the cherednik correspondence between quantum affine knizhnik zamolodchikov equations and the eigenvalue problems of macdonald type in this review we focus on the rank one cases ie on the reduced type and the non reduced type  to which the associated macdonald koornwinder polynomials are the rogers polynomials and the askey wilson polynomials respectively we give detailed computations and formulas that may be difficult to find in the literature the second part s  is a complement of the first part and is also a continuation of our previous study y y  on the parameter specialization of macdonald koornwinder polynomials where we found four types of specialization of the type parameters which could be called the askey wilson parameters to recover the type  in this note we show that among the four specializations there is only one which is compatible with the bispectral correspondence discussed in the first part\",\"we present a kinetic

expansion sums of iterated riemann integrals over nested commutators with correction term is derived for the situation that the lie algebra is inherited by an infinite dimensional lie group in milnors sense in the context of banach lie groups and lie groups with suitable regularity properties we generalize the baker campbell dynkin hausdorff formula to the product integral with additional nilpotency assumption in the non banach case we combine this formula with the results obtained for the lax equation to derive an explicit representation of the product integral in terms of the exponential map an important ingredient in the non banach case is an integral transformation that we introduce this transformation maps continuous lie algebra valued curves to smooth ones and leaves the product integral invariant this transformation is also used to prove a regularity statement in the asymptotic estimate context\",\"finite semisimple commutative group algebras for which all the

characterized the infinity category of derived manifolds up to equivalence by a universal property on the other hand it is shown in recent work of behrend liao xu that the category of differential graded manifolds admits a homotopy theory in this paper we prove that the associated infinity category of dg manifolds is equivalent to that of derived manifolds this allows the well developed theory of dg geometry to live in symbiosis with infinity categorical approach to derived differential geometry as a consequence we prove that a dg c infinity algebra is homotopically finitely presented if and only if it is quasi isomorphic to smooth functions on a dg manifold\",\"we introduce a notion of a root groupoid as a replacement of the notion of weyl group for kac moody lie superalgebras the objects of the root groupoid classify certain root data the arrows are defined by generators and relations as an abstract groupoid the root groupoid has many connected components and we show that to

scale parameter under initial conditions where the system is in a local gibbs state with parameters corresponding to density and temperature with gradients of order  assuming that the phase space density of the particles is given by a suitable series in epsilon the behavior of the system under this rescaling is described to the lowest order in epsilon by new non classical hydrodynamic

the parametric elliptic pde on a spatial domain  with a scalar piecewise constant diffusion coefficient taking any positive values on fixed subdomains  this problem is not uniformly elliptic as the contrast can be arbitrarily high contrarily to the uniform ellipticity assumption uea that is commonly made on parametric elliptic pdes based on local polynomial approximations in the variable we construct local and global reduced model spaces of moderate dimension that approximate uniformly well all solutions  since the solution blows as  the solution manifold is not a compact set and does not have finite width therefore our results for approximation by such spaces are formulated in terms of relative projection error that is after normalization by  we prove that this relative error decays exponentially with  yet exhibiting the curse of dimensionality as the number of subdomains grows we also show similar rates for the galerkin projection despite the fact that high contrast is well known to deteriorate the multiplicative constant when applying ceas lemma we finally establish uniform estimates in relative error for the state estimation and parameter estimation inverse

constant magnetic field this extends to the magnetic setting a famous result by guillemin on the two sphere we characterize zoll magnetic systems as zeros of a suitable action functional  and then look for its zeros by means of a nash moser implicit function theorem this requires showing the right invertibility of the linearized operator in a neighborhood of the flat metric and constant magnetic field and establishing tame estimates for the right inverse as key step we prove the invertibility of the normal operator which unlike in guillemins case is pseudo differential only at the highest order we overcome this difficulty noting that by the asymptotic properties of bessel functions the lower order expansion of is a sum of fourier integral operators we then use a resolvent

regularizations with total variation tv and total generalized variation tgv are some of the best known methods in image denoising however like other variational models including a fidelity term they crucially depend on the choice of their tuning parameters a remedy is to choose these automatically through multilevel approaches for example by optimizing performance on noisyclean image pairs in this work we consider such methods with space dependent parameters which are piecewise constant on dyadic grids with the grid itself being part of the minimization we prove existence of minimizers for fixed discontinuous parameters that box constraints for the values of the parameters lead to existence of finite optimal partitions and converse results for well prepared data on the numerical side we consider a simple subdivision scheme for optimal partitions built on top of any other bilevel optimization method for scalar parameters and demonstrate its improved performance on some representative

bundle assumption by allowing the spin dirac operators to be twisted by isomorphic vector bundles and to establish the graded additivity of the bismut cheeger eta form using these results we give alternative proofs of the fact that the analytic index in differential theory is a well defined group homomorphism and the riemann roch grothendieck theorem in theory\",\"hyperbolic structures equivalently principal bundles with connection on link complements can be described algebraically by using the octahedral decomposition which assigns an ideal triangulation to any diagram of the link the decomposition like any ideal triangulation gives a set of gluing equations in shape parameters whose solutions are hyperbolic structures we show that these equations are closely related to a certain presentation of the kac de concini quantum group in terms of cluster algebras at a root of unity specifically we identify ratios of the shape parameters of the octahedral decomposition with

equilibria with connected support on the whole space  including those that are non monotone the problem can be solved completely mode by mode for each spatial wave number and their longtime dynamics is intimately tied to the survival threshold of wave numbers computed by where is the maximal speed of particle velocities it is shown that purely oscillatory electric fields exist and obey a klein gordons type dispersion relation for wave numbers below the threshold thus confirming the existence of langmuirs oscillatory waves known in the physical literature at the threshold the phase velocity of these oscillatory waves enters the range of admissible particle velocities namely there are particles that move at the same propagation speed of the waves it is this exact resonant interaction between particles and the oscillatory fields that causes the waves to be damped classically known as landau damping landaus law of decay is explicitly computed and is sensitive to the decaying rate of the background equilibria the faster it decays at the maximal velocity the weaker landau damping is beyond the threshold the electric fields are a perturbation of those generated by the free transport dynamics and thus decay rapidly fast due to the phase mixing mechanism\",\"assuming the heat kernel on a doubling dirichlet metric measure space has a generalized sub gaussian bound we prove an asymptotically sharp spectral upper bound on the survival probability of the associated diffusion process as a consequence we can show that the supremum of the mean exit time over all starting points

that its dg singularity category is quasi equivalent to the perfect dg derived category of a dg leavitt path algebra the result might be viewed as a deformed version of the known description of the dg singularity category of a radical square zero algebra in terms of a leavitt path algebra with trivial differential the above result is achieved in two steps we first introduce the singular yoneda dg category of  which is quasi equivalent to the dg singularity category of  the construction of this new dg category follows from a general operation for dg categories namely an explicit dg localization inverting a natural transformation from the identity functor to a dg endofunctor this localization turns out to be quasi equivalent to a dg quotient category secondly we prove that the endomorphism algebra of the quotient of modulo its jacobson radical in the singular yoneda dg category is isomorphic to the dg leavitt path algebra the appendix is devoted to an alternative proof of the result using koszul moore duality and derived localizations\",\"a variation in the environment of a system such as the temperature the concentration of a chemical solution or the appearance of a magnetic field may lead to a drift in one of the parameters if the parameter crosses a bifurcation point the system can tip from one attractor to another bifurcation induced tipping typically this stability exchange occurs at a parameter value beyond the bifurcation value this is what we call here the stability exchange shift we study systematically how the shift is affected by the initial parameter value and its change rate to that end we present numerical and analytical results for different types of bifurcations and different paradigmatic systems finally we deduce the scaling laws governing this phenomenon we show that increasing the change rate and starting the drift further from the bifurcation can delay the tipping process furthermore if the change rate is sufficiently small the shift becomes independent of the initial condition no memory and the shift tends to zero as the square root of the change rate thus the bifurcation diagram for the system with fixed parameters is recovered\",\"the notion of embedding tensors and the associated tensor hierarchies form an effective tool for the construction of supergravity and higher gauge theories embedding tensors and related structures are extensively studied also in the mathematics literature on the other hand hom lie algebras were introduced in the study of deformations of witt and virasoro algebras in this paper we first introduce embedding tensors on a hom lie algebra with respect to a given representation an embedding tensor naturally induces a hom leibniz algebra structure we construct a graded lie algebra

darboux matrices corresponding to the various types of solitons to investigate soliton interactions in the focusing ccspe the study combines refactorization problems on generators of certain rational loop groups and long time asymptotics of these generators as well as the main refactorization theorem for the dressing factors which leads to the yang baxter property for the refactorization map and the vector soliton interactions among the results obtained in this paper we derive explicit formulas for the polarization shift of fundamental solitons which are the analog of the well known formulas for the interaction of vector solitons in the manakov system our study also reveals that upon interacting with a fundamental breather a fundamental soliton becomes a fundamental breather and conversely that the interaction of two fundamental breathers generically yields two fundamental breathers with a polarization shifts but may also result into a fundamental soliton and a fundamental breather explicit formulas for the coefficients that characterize the fundamental breathers as well as for their polarization vectors are obtained the interactions of other types of solitons are also

in the proposed bilinearization we make use of an auxiliary function to convert the trilinear equations into a set of bilinear equations we obtain bright soliton soliton solutions and present the scheme for obtaining n soliton solution in the soliton solution the presence of an additional parameter allows tuning the position of soliton we find that the proposed scheme of bilinearization using

infinite index inclusions like crossed products by outer actions of discrete quantum groups cores of cuntz algebras  and certain valued semicircular systems in our main result we prove irreducible c discrete inclusions are precisely crossed products by outer actions of unitary tensor categories and certain c algebra objects in analogy with subfactors one should view the tensor category its action and the c algebra object as the standard invariant for a c discrete inclusion conversely we show every abstract standard invariant is realized by some c discrete inclusion which is a c analogue of

level and describe a model for the path category now considered as a category enriched over differential graded dg coalgebras in terms of a suitable algebraic chain model for the underlying simplicial set this is achieved through a version of the cobar functor inspired by lazarev and holsteins categorical koszul duality as a consequence we obtain a conceptual explanation of a result of franz

quantum system equipped with a covariant positive operator valued measure povm and build a framework on the concept of operational equivalence that allows us to enforce operationality by quotienting the quantum state spaces with equivalence relation of indistinguishability by the available effects assumed to be invariant under gauge transformations and framed in the sense of respecting the choice of the frames povm such effects are accessed via the yen construction which maps effects on the system to those on the composite system satisfying gauge invariance and framing they are called relative

in the case of type iii von neumann algebras\",\"let be a finite abelian group of odd order equipped with a non degenerate alternating form  we give closed formulas for the character values of the weil representation associated with  these formulas generalize the ones given by s gurevich and r hadani  and by t thomas   from finite vector spaces to abelian groups our formulas do not involve the choice of a lagrangian subgroup of  our proofs are based on an elementary algebraic approach introduced by h n ward   for finite vector spaces over fields\",\"we define generalized koszul modules and

global dimension then is generalized as regular if and only if the koszul dual of is self injective\",\"in this note we prove that for a complete noncompact three dimensional riemannian manifold with bounded sectional curvature if it has uniformly positive scalar curvature then there is a uniform lower bound on the injectivity radius\",\"in this paper we study gradient estimates for positive weak solutions to the following laplacian equation on a riemannian manifold where and are two nonzero real constants by virtue of the morser iteration technique we derive some gradient estimates which show

baxterization process of braid group representations we discuss the corresponding cb algebras in the yang baxterization process we present diagrams of the relations for the cb algebras these relations are illustrated using the isomorphism between the general free algebra generated by   and and kauffmans tangle algebra\",\"in this paper we investigate the initial boundary value problem of the following nonlinear extensible beam equation with nonlinear damping term which was considered by yang et al advanced nonlinear studies    we consider the problem with the nonlinear damping and establish the finite time blow up of the solution for the initial data at arbitrary high energy level including the estimate lower and upper bounds of the blowup time the result provides some affirmative answer to the open problems given in advanced nonlinear studies   \",\"we establish various qualitative properties of liquid lane emden stars in  including bounds for its density profile and radius  using them we prove that against radial perturbations the liquid lane emden stars are linearly stable when  linearly stable when for stars with small relative central density  and linearly unstable when for stars with large central density such dependence on central density is not seen in the gaseous lane emden stars\",\"we prove that a virtually periodic object in an abelian category gives rise to a non vanishing result on certain hom groups in the singularity category consequently for any artin algebra with infinite global dimension its singularity category has no silting subcategory and the associated differential graded leavitt algebra has a non vanishing cohomology in each degree we verify the singular presilting conjecture for singularly minimal algebras and ultimately closed algebras we obtain a trichotomy on the hom finiteness of the cohomology of differential graded leavitt algebras\",\"in this work we study the variational problem associated to dimer models a class of models from integrable probability and statistical mechanics in dimension two which have been the focus of intense research efforts over the last decades these models give rise to an infinite family of non differentiable functionals on lipschitz functions with gradient constraint determined by solutions of the dirichlet problem on compact convex polygons for a class of monge ampere equations we settle a number or outstanding open questions for this infinite class functionals in particular we prove a complete classification of the regularity of minimizers also known as height functions for all dimer models for a natural class of polygonal simply or multiply connected domains much studied in numerical simulations and elsewhere our classification in particular implies that the pokrovsky talapov law holds for all dimer models at a generic point on the frozen boundary and in addition shows a very strong local rigidity of dimer models which can be interpreted as a geometric universality result furthermore we give a complete classification of the regularity of the associated free boundary also known in the literature as frozen boundary or arctic curves and prove that they are all algebraic curves the lack of differentiability of the functionals is intimately connected to the boundary behaviour of the solutions to the monge ampere equations and we prove a complete classification for these of independent interest\",\"we consider the maximally symmetric distribution given by the an nurowski circle twistor bundle over the product of an an nurowski surface and the plane this circle twistor distribution encodes the configuration space of an an nurowski surface rolling without slipping or twisting on the plane we calculate the vector fields associated to

time independent schrodinger equation for the rosen morse type potential by using the nikiforov uvarov method we obtain in a systematic way the complete solution of such equation which includes the so called bound states square integrable solutions associated with the discrete spectrum as well as unbound states region bounded but not necessarily square integrable solutions related to the continuous part of the spectrum the resolution of this problem is used to show that the kinks of the non linear klein gordon equation with type potentials are stable we also derive the orthogonality and completeness relations satisfied by the set of eigenfunctions which are useful in the description of the dynamics of kinks under perturbations or interacting with antikinks\",\"let be a schottky

analysis of the fourier systems easily extends to other semi linear wave equations such as the co rotational wave map equation\",\"we analyze the case of a dense mkdv soliton gas and its large time behaviour in the presence of a single trial soliton we show that the solution can be expressed in terms of fredholm determinants as well as in terms of a riemann hilbert problem we then show that the solution can be decomposed as the sum of the background gas solution a modulated elliptic wave plus a soliton solution the individual expressions are however quite convoluted due to the interaction dynamics additionally we are able to derive the local phase shift of the gas after the passage of the soliton and we can trace the location of the soliton peak as the dynamics evolves finally we show that the soliton peak while interacting with the soliton gas has an oscillatory velocity whose leading order average value satisfies the kinetic velocity equation analogous to the one posited by v zakharov and g el\",\"recently relative braid group actions on quantum groups of arbitrary finite types have been constructed by wang and the author in this paper we extend that construction to

partition function of four dimensional euclidean non supersymmetric su yang mills theory is calculated in the perturbative and weak coupling regime ie in a small open ball about the flat connection what we call the vicinity of the vacuum and when the gauge coupling constant acquires a small but finite value the computation is based on various known inequalities valid only in four dimensions providing two sided estimates for the exponentiated yang mills action in terms of the norm of the derivative of the gauge potential only these estimates then give rise to gaussian like infinite dimensional integrals involving the laplacian hence can be formally computed via zeta function and heat kernel techniques it then turns out that these integrals give a sharp value for the partition function in the aforementioned perturbative and weak coupling regime of the theory in the resulting expression for the partition function the original classical coupling constant is shifted to a smaller one which can be interpreted as the manifestation in this approach of the existence a non trivial trivial function and asymptotic freedom in non abelian gauge theories\",\"we propose a systematic generating procedure to construct free lagrangians for massive massless and partially massless totally symmetric tensor fields on starting from the brst lagrangian description of massless fields in the flat ambient space  a novelty is that the lagrangian is described by a form on whose pullback to gives the genuine lagrangian defined on anti de sitter spacetime our derivation uses the triplet formulation originating from the first quantized brst approach where the action principle is determined by the brst operator and the inner product of a first quantised system in this way we build in a manifestly covariant manner a unifying action principle for the three types of fields mentioned above in particular our derivation justifies the form of some actions proposed earlier for massive and massless fields on ads we also give a general setup for ambient lagrangians in terms of the respective jet bundles and variational bi complexes in particular we introduce a suitable ambient space euler lagrange differential which allows to derive the equation of motion ambiently ie without the need to explicitly derive the respective spacetime lagrangian\",\"we study one loop perturbative properties of scalar field theories on the minkowski space the corresponding star product together with the involution are characterized from a combination of weyl quantization and defining properties of the convolution algebra of the euclidean group linked to the coordinate algebra of the minkowski space the natural integration measure linked to the haar measure of the euclidean group defines a trace for the star product one loop properties of the point and point functions for families of complex valued scalar field theories on minkowski space are examined for scalar theories with orientable interaction the point function is found to receive uv quadratically diverging one loop corrections in dimensions while no ir singularities generating uvir mixing appears these however occur in the one loop corrections to the point function as well one loop point functions for theories with non orientable interaction involve such ir singularities these results are discussed\",\"the classical buscher rules describe t duality for metrics and b fields in a topologically trivial setting on the other hand topological t duality addresses aspects of non trivial topology while neglecting metrics and b fields in this article we develop a new unifying framework for both aspects\",\"we provide a unified description of the three covariant superspace approaches to conformal supergravity in four dimensions i conformal superspace ii superspace and iii superspace each of them can be used to formulate general supergravity matter systems although conformal superspace has the largest structure group and is intimately related to the superconformal tensor calculus we review the structure of covariant projective multiplets and demonstrate how they are used to describe pure and matter coupled supergravity including locally superconformal off shell sigma models higher derivative invariants topological invariants and super weyl anomalies are also briefly discussed\",\"a large class of gapped phases of matter can be described by topological finite group gauge theories in this paper we derive the group global symmetry and its t hooft anomaly for topological finite group gauge theories in space time dimensions including non abelian gauge groups and dijkgraaf witten twists we focus on the form symmetry generated by invertible abelian magnetic defects and the higher form symmetries generated by invertible topological defects decorated with lower dimensional gauged symmetry protected topological spt phases we show that due to a generalization of the witten effect and charge flux attachment the form symmetry generated by the magnetic defects mixes with other symmetries into a higher group we describe such higher group symmetry in various lattice model examples we discuss several applications including the classification of fermionic spt phases in d for general fermionic symmetry groups where we also derive a simpler formula for the obstruction than has appeared in previous work we also show how the group symmetry is related to fault tolerant non pauli logical gates and a refined clifford hierarchy in stabilizer codes we construct new logical gates in stabilizer codes using the group symmetry such as the control z gate in d toric code\",\"in this paper we classify the orbits of the group slf on the space fotimes fotimes f for fc and fr this is known as the classification of complex and real qutrit states we also give an overview of physical theories where these classifications are relevant\",\"in this paper we give a new effective superpotential that makes clear bethegauge correspondence between d and d gauge theories and open and  spin chains with diagonal boundary conditions and also works in the case of d and d type gauge theories which is not previously discussed in the literature especially for exceptional lie algebras   we give the effective superpotential and vacuum equations for  we only give theirs effective superpotential for convenience\",\"two theorems involving curl eigenfields on the sphere are obtained using angular momentum theory spinor hyperspherical harmonics are shown to form an explicit convenient basis in particular a spin one vector calculus is reviewed an easy proof of the vanishing of odd eigenfields is given and related to the sign change of fermionic spinors under rotations the theorem that curl eigenfields with constant norm have to be proportional to a fundamental eigenfield hopf field is also rapidly obtained attention is drawn to the relevance of early work of schrodinger on maxwell theory in an expanding universe\",\"this brief note publicizes the quantum framework for symmetry that is developed in our joint paper arxiv with greg moore and constantin teleman we include additional motivation and an application to a selection rule for line defects in dimensional gauge theories\",\"i rigorously analyze a proposal introduced by drterno about a spatial localization observable for a klein gordon massive real particle in terms of a poincare covariant family of povms i prove that these povms are actually a kinematic deformation of the newton wigner pvms the first moment of one of these povms however exactly coincides with a restriction on a core of the newton wigner selfadjoint position operator though the second moment does not this fact permits to preserve all nice properties of the newton wigner position observable dropping the unphysical features arising from the hegerfeldt theorem the considered povm does not permit spatially sharply localized states but it admits families of almost localized states with arbitrary precision next i establish that the terno localization observable satisfies part of a requirement introduced by dplcastrigiano about causal temporal evolution concerning the lebesgue measurable spatial regions of any minkowskian reference frame the validity of the complete castrigianos causality requirement is also proved for a notion of spatial localization which generalizes ternos one in a natural way\",\"higher order tensors appear in various areas of mechanics as well as physics medicine or earth sciences as these tensors are highly complex most are not well understood thus the analysis and the visualization process form a highly challenging task in order to solve this problem a suitable tensor decomposition for arbitrary tensors is desirable since many real world examples are described in the three dimensional space this paper will also focus on this space tensors of order zero and one are well understood and for second order tensors the well known spectral decomposition exists however there is no standard decomposition for tensors of order higher than two this work will focus on summarizing facts about the deviatoric decomposition and on its calculation in a recursive way it decomposes a tensor of arbitrary order into a sum of orthogonal irreducible parts thus into parts that are orthogonal and invariant under rotation these irreducible parts are based on so called deviators the calculations and results of the deviatoric decomposition are not broadly understood in the engineering community to change this situation information about this decomposition from a range of literature sources was gathered and will be summarized and explained in this work to make further analysis possible different applications and examples for often used physical tensors will also be given the goal of this work is to give other researchers the chance to also use this knowledge\",\"the purpose of this paper is to investigate the global categorical symmetries that arise when gauging finite higher groups in three or more dimensions the motivation is to provide a common perspective on constructions of non invertible global symmetries in higher dimensions and a precise description of the associated symmetry categories this paper focusses on gauging finite groups and split groups in three dimensions in addition to topological wilson lines we show that this generates a rich spectrum of topological surface defects labelled by representations and explain their connection to condensation defects for wilson lines we derive various properties of the topological defects and show that the associated symmetry category is the fusion category of representations this allows us to determine the full symmetry categories of certain gauge theories with disconnected gauge groups a subsequent paper will examine gauging more general higher groups in higher dimensions\",\"we show that the spectral action when perturbed by a gauge potential can be written as a series of chern simons actions and yang mills actions of all orders in the odd orders generalized chern simons forms are integrated against an odd cocycle whereas in the even orders powers of the curvature are integrated against cocycles that are hochschild cocycles as well in both cases the hochschild cochains are derived from the taylor series expansion of the spectral action tr in powers of  but unlike the taylor expansion we expand in increasing order of the forms in  this extends connes chamseddine  which computes only the scale invariant part of the spectral action works in dimension at most  and assumes the vanishing tadpole hypothesis in our situation we obtain a truly infinite odd cocycle the analysis involved draws from recent results in multiple operator integration which also allows us to give conditions under which this cocycle is entire and under which our expansion is absolutely convergent as a consequence of our expansion and of the gauge invariance of the spectral action we show that the odd cocycle pairs trivially with \",\"we consider a simple model for qcd dynamics in which dglap integro differential equation may be solved analytically this is a gauge model which possesses dominant evolution of gauge boson gluon distribution and in which the gauge coupling does not run this may be supersymmetric gauge theory with softly broken supersymmetry other finite supersymmetric gauge theory with lower level of supersymmetry or topological chern simons field theories we maintain only one term in the splitting function of unintegrated gluon distribution and solve dglap analytically for this simplified splitting function the solution is found by use of the cauchy integral formula the solution restricts form of the unintegrated gluon distribution as function of momentum transfer and of bjorken  then we consider an almost realistic splitting function of unintegrated gluon distribution as an input to dglap equation and solve it by the same method which we have developed to solve dglap equation for the toy model we study a result obtained for the realistic gluon distribution and find a singular bessel like behaviour in the vicinity of the point and a smooth behaviour in the vicinity of the point\",\"in this article we prove spin statistics theorem for arbitrary massive a b field in a representation theoretic manner general gamma matrices are introduced and explicit forms for low spin are calculated spin sums and twisted spin sums are introduced to prove spin statistics and derive field equations respectively and their relations are discussed klein gordan equation is just the condition on the momentum dirac equation or

azimuthal angle we study its quantum symmetries the poincare quantum group and analyse the concepts of localizability and quantum observers\",\"arbitrary right connections on bicovariant bimodules of a quantum group hopf algebra are shown to canonically extend to tensor products of bicovariant bimodules in particular a connection on a bicovariant bimodule of one forms or the dual one of vector fields extends to the braided symmetric tensor product of forms or vector fields this allows to define a metric compatibility condition between an arbitrary connection and an arbitrary braided symmetric metric associated with a bicovariant differential calculus on a quantum group the metric compatibility condition and the torsion free condition are solved for metrics conformal to central and equivariant metrics provided the braiding given by the differential calculus is diagonalizable and an associated map invertible thus existence and uniqueness of the levi civita connection on a quantum group for this class of metrics that are neither central nor equivariant is proven\",\"we report a rigorous quantization of topological quantum mechanics on and in perturbative bv bfv formalism costellos homotopic renormalization is extended and incorporated in our construction moreover bv quantization of the same model studied in our previous work is derived from the bv bfv quantization leading to a comparison between different interpretations of state in these two frameworks\",\"the open n string theory is defined on the four dimensional space time with the split signature    the string field theory action of the open n string theory is described by the four dimensional wess zumino witten wzw model equation of motion of the wzw model is the yang equation which is equivalent to the anti self dual yang mills equation in this paper we study soliton type classical solutions of the wzw model in the split signature by calculating the action density of the wzw model we find that the action density of the one soliton solutions is localized on a three dimensional hyperplane this shows that there would be codimension one solitonic objects or equivalently some kind of three branes in the open n string theory we also prove that in the asymptotic region of the space time the action density of the n soliton solutions is a nonlinear superposition of n one solitons this suggests the existence of intersecting n three branes in the n strings finally we make a reduction to a  dimensional real space time to calculate energy densities of the soliton solutions we can successfully evaluate the energy distribution for the two soliton solutions and find that there is no singularity in the interacting region this implies the existence of smooth intersecting codimension one branes in the whole region soliton solutions in the euclidean signature are also discussed\",\"extending the work of the first author we introduce a notion of semisimple topological field theory in arbitrary even dimension and show that such field theories necessarily lead to stable diffeomorphism invariants the main result of this paper is a proof that this upper bound is optimal to this end we introduce and study a class of semisimple topological field theories generalizing the well known finite gauge theories constructed by dijkgraaf witten freed and quinn we show that manifolds satisfying a certain finiteness condition including manifolds with finite fundamental group are indistinguishable to these field theories if and only if they are stably diffeomorphic hence such generalized dijkgraaf witten theories provide the strongest semisimple tft invariants possible these results hold for a large class of ambient tangential structures we discuss a number of applications including the constructions of unoriented dimensional semisimple field theories which can distinguish unoriented smooth structure and oriented higher dimensional semisimple field theories which can distinguish certain exotic spheres along the way we show that dimensional reductions of generalized dijkgraaf witten theories are again generalized dijkgraaf witten theories we utilize ambidexterity in the rational setting and we develop techniques related to the categorical moebius inversion principle of galvez carrillo kock tonks\",\"we apply ourselves to the noncommutative geometry of frame bundles by showing that each c algebraic noncommutative principal bundle is up to isomorphism uniquely determined by its associated noncommutative vector bundle with

system with the property that its associated noncommutative vector bundle with respect to the standard representation of is isomorphic to \",\"we derive the exact form of the spectral interaction of two strings mediated by a constant scalar field using methods derived from noncommutative geometry this is achieved by considering a non product modification of the connes lott model with two dimensional manifolds the analogy with the latter construction justifies the interpretation of the scalar field as being of higgs type working in dimension two requires the use of the spectral zeta function instead of the wodzicki residue techniques applicable to four dimensional models in the latter case an analogous non product geometry construction leads for specific choices of metrics to the so called doubled geometry models which can be thought of as a spectral modification of the hassan rosen bimetric theory we find that in dimension two the interaction term depends explicitly on zweibeins defining the dirac operators and only in some special cases can they be expressed solely using the metrics the computations can be performed analytically for an arbitrary choice of zweibeins defining geometry on the two strings\",\"we study the classical and quantum properties of galilean fermions in  dimensions we have taken the case of massless galilean fermions minimally coupled to the scalar field at the classical level the lagrangian is obtained by null reducing the relativistic theory in one higher dimension the resulting theory is found to be invariant under infinite galilean conformal symmetries using noethers procedure we construct the corresponding infinite conserved charges path integral techniques are then employed to probe the quantum properties of the theory the theory is found to be renormalizable a novel feature of the theory is the emergence of mass scale at the first order of quantum correction the conformal symmetry of the theory breaks at the quantum level we confirm this by constructing the beta function of the theory\",\"the stable envelopes of okounkov et al realize some representations of quantum algebras associated to quivers using geometry

this note we propose a decomposition of the quantum matrix group sl as deformed exponentiation of the quantum algebra generators of faddeevs modular double of  the formula is checked by relating hyperbolic representation matrices with the whittaker function this is important for both d liouville gravity and d pure gravity since both are governed by this algebraic structure this result builds towards a bf formulation of the amplitudes of both of these gravitational models\",\"we propose an interesting bpscft correspondence playground the correlation function of two intersecting half bps

deformations\",\"we construct a generalization of poisson chern simons theory defined on any supermanifold equipped with an appropriate filtration of the tangent bundle our construction recovers interacting eleven dimensional supergravity in cederwalls formulation as well as all possible twists of the theory and does so in a uniform and geometric fashion among other things this proves that costellos description of the maximal twist is the twist of eleven dimensional supergravity in its pure spinor description it also provides a pure spinor lift of the interactions in the minimally twisted theory our techniques enhance the bv formulation of the interactions of each theory to a homotopy poisson structure by defining a compatible graded commutative product this suggests interpretations in terms of deformations of geometric structures on superspace and provides some concrete evidence for a first quantized origin of the theories\",\"we reformulate the question of the absence of global anomalies of heterotic string theory mathematically in terms of a certain natural transformation  from topological modular forms to the anderson dual of string bordism groups using the segal stolz teichner conjecture we will show that this natural transformation vanishes implying that heterotic global anomalies are always absent the fact that plays an important role in the process along the way we also discuss how the twists of can be described under the segal stolz teichner conjecture by using the result of freed and hopkins concerning anomalies of quantum field theories the paper contains separate introductions for mathematicians and for string theorists in the hope of making the content more accessible to a larger audience the sections are also demarcated cleanly into mathematically rigorous parts and those which are not\",\"we construct and compare two alternative quantizations as a time orderable prefactorization algebra and as an algebraic quantum field theory valued in cochain complexes of a natural collection of free bv theories on the category of dimensional globally hyperbolic lorentzian manifolds our comparison is realized as an explicit isomorphism of time orderable prefactorization algebras the key ingredients of our approach are the retarded and advanced greens homotopies associated with free bv theories which generalize retarded and advanced greens operators to cochain complexes of linear differential operators\",\"we introduce a technique to realise brane wrapping and double dimensional reduction in the context of aksz topological sigma models and also in their target spaces which are symplectic algebroids ie qp manifolds our procedure involves a novel coisotropic reduction combined with an aksz transgression that realises degree shifting the reduced qp manifold depends on topological data of the wrapped cycle we check our procedure against the known rules for fluxes under wrapping in the context of m theorytype iia duality and we also find a new relation between courant algebroids and poisson manifolds\",\"the so called takahashis emphinversion theorem the reconstruction of a given spinor based on its bilinear covariants are re examined considering alternative dual structures in contrast to the classical results where the dirac dual structure plays the central role new duals are built using the discrete symmetries  their combinations are also taken into account furthermore the imposition of a new adjoint structure led us also to re examine the representation of the clifford algebra basis elements uncovering new bilinear structures and a new fierz aggregate those results might help construct theories for new beyond standard model fields\",\"in this paper we use the language of noncommutative differential geometry to formalise discrete differential calculus we begin with a brief review of inverse limit of posets as an approximation of topological spaces we then show how to associate a algebra over a poset giving it a piecewise linear structure furthermore we explain how dually the algebra of continuous function over a manifold can be approximated by a direct limit of

constraints that define the irreducible higher spin representations in its turn the constrains are divided into differential and purely algebraic or holonomic the necessary and sufficient conditions to derive the consistent lagrangian formulations for irreducible interacting higher spin fields within approach with incomplete brst operator where the algebraic constraints are not included into definition of the brst operator but imposed by hands on the field and gauge parameter vectors are considered it is shown that in addition to that such constraints should anticommute with the brst operator and annihilate the fields and gauge parameters fock space vectors they must form the abelian superalgebra both with the brst operator above and with operators of cubic quartic and etc vertices only under the above conditions the formulations with complete and incomplete brst charges turn out to be equivalent and yield to the same interaction vertices in terms of irreducible

develop an embedding formalism for anti de sitter ads superspaces in three dimensions by using a modified version of their supertwistor description given in the literature a coset construction for these superspaces is worked out we put forward a program of constructing a supersymmetric analogue of the banados metric which is expected to be a deformation of the ads superspace geometry by a two dimensional conformal supercurrent multiplet\",\"we consider the dirac equations in static spherically symmetric space times and we present a type of spinor field whose structure allows the separation of elevation angle and radial coordinate in very general situations we demonstrate that after such a separation of variables the dirac equations reduce to two equations that can always be integrated at least in principle to prove that ours is a fully working method we find an explicit exact solution in the special case of the de sitter universe\",\"one of the general strategies for realizing a wide class of interacting qfts is via junctions and intersections of higher dimensional bulk theories in the context of stringm theory this includes many superconformal field theories scfts coupled to an ir free bulk gauging the flavor symmetries of these theories and allowing position dependent gauge couplings provides a general strategy for realizing novel higher dimensional junctions of theories coupled to localized edge modes here we show that m theory on singular asymptotically conical holonomy orbifolds provides a general template for realizing strongly coupled d bulk theories with d edge modes this geometric approach also shows how bulk generalized symmetries are inherited in the boundary system\",\"we review recent discussions regarding the parity odd contribution to the trace anomaly of a chiral fermion we pay special attention to the perturbative approach in terms of feynman diagrams comparing in detail the results obtained using dimensional regularization and the breitenlohner maison prescription with other approaches\",\"we study geodesics flows on curved quantum riemannian geometries using a recent formulation in terms of bimodule connections and completely positive maps we complete this formalism with a canonical operation on noncommutative vector fields we show on a classical manifold how the ricci tensor arises naturally in our approach as a term in the convective derivative of the divergence of the geodesic velocity field and use this to propose a similar object in the noncommutative case examples include quantum geodesic flows on the algebra of x matrices fuzzy spheres and the sphere\",\"the brst structure of the extended bondi metzner sachs symmetry group of asymptotically flat manifolds is investigated using the recently introduced framework of the beltrami field parametrization of four dimensional metrics the latter identifies geometrically the two physical degrees of freedom of the graviton as fundamental fields the graded brst bms nilpotent differential operator relies on four horizontality conditions giving a lagrangian reformulation of the asymptotic bms symmetry a series of cocycles is found which indicate the possibility of anomalies for three dimensional lagrangian theories to be built in the null boundaries of asymptotically flat spaces from the principle of brst bms invariance\",\"we provide an intrinsic formulation of the noncommutative differential geometry developed earlier by chaichian tureanu r b zhang and the second author this yields geometric definitions of covariant derivatives of noncommutative metrics and curvatures as well as the noncommutative version of the first and the second bianchi identities moreover if a noncommutative metric and chiral coefficients satisfy certain conditions which hold automatically for quantum fluctuations given by isometric embedding we prove that the two noncommutative ricci curvatures are essentially equivalent finally we show that the quantum fluctuations and their curvatures have close forms if pseudo  riemannian metrics are given by certain type of spherically symmetric isometric embeddings hence the quantization of gravity is renormalizable in this case\",\"there are two major ways of constructing d superconformal field theories scfts the first one is putting a d theory on a punctured riemann surface class s theory and the second one is putting type iib string theory on a d canonical singularity as there are interests on low rank theories we search all the possibilities from above two constructions most of those theories are engineered by class s theory with irregular singularities and we find a universal formula for the rank of theory so that a complete search is possible we then compute various physical quantities of those theories such as the central charges flavor symmetry associated vertex operator algebra and higgs branch etc one of interesting consequence of our results are the prediction of many new isomorphism of d vertex operator algebra\",\"even though its classical equations of motion are then left invariant when an action is redefined by an additive total derivative or divergence term in time in the case of a mechanical system such a transformation induces nontrivial consequences for the systems canonical phase space formulation this is even more true and then in more subtle ways for the canonically quantised dynamics with in particular an induced transformation in the unitary configuration space representation of the heisenberg algebra being used for the quantum system when coupled to a background gauge field such considerations become crucial for a proper understanding of the consequences for the systems quantum dynamics of gauge transformations of that classical external background gauge field while under such transformations the systems degrees of freedom abstract quantum states and quantum dynamics are certainly strictly invariant after a detailed analysis of these different points in a general context these are then illustrated specifically in the case of the quantum landau problem with its classical external background magnetic vector potential for which the most general possible parametrised gauge choice is implemented herein the latter discussion aims as well to clarify some perplexing statements in the literature regarding the status of gauge choices to be made for the magnetic vector potential for that quantum system the role of the global space time symmetries of the landau problem and their gauge invariant noether charges is then also emphasized\",\"we review both the kinematics and dynamics of non lorentzian theories and their associated geometries first we introduce non lorentzian kinematical spacetimes and their symmetry algebras next we construct actions describing the particle dynamics in some of these kinematical spaces using the method of nonlinear realisations we explain the relation with the coadjoint orbit

constant in terms of a topological quantum field theory based on the quantization of the teichmuller space of riemann surfaces that we refer to as virasoro tqft this tqft is similar but importantly not equivalent to chern simons theory this sharpens the folklore that d gravity is related to chern simons theory into a precise correspondence and resolves some well known issues with this lore at the quantum level our proposal is computationally very useful and provides a powerful tool for the further study of d gravity in particular we explain how together with standard tqft surgery techniques this leads to a fully algorithmic procedure for the computation of the gravity partition function on a fixed topology exactly in the central charge mathematically the relation leads to many nontrivial conjectures for hyperbolic manifolds virasoro conformal blocks and crossing kernels\",\"we present a general algebraic framework for gauging a form compact connected lie group symmetry in d topological phases starting from a symmetry fractionalization pattern of the lie group  we first extend to a larger symmetry group  such that there is no fractionalization with respect to in the topological phase and the effect of gauging is to tensor the original theory with a chern simons theory to restore the desired gauge symmetry one then has to gauge an appropriate one form symmetry or condensing certain abelian anyons to obtain the final result studying the consistency of the gauging procedure leads to compatibility conditions between the symmetry fractionalization pattern and the hall conductance when the gauging can not be consistently done ie the compatibility conditions can not be satisfied the symmetry with the fractionalization pattern has an t hooft anomaly and we present a general method to determine the d topological term for the anomaly we provide many examples including projective simple lie groups and unitary groups to illustrate our approach\",\"d topological phases of matter can host a broad class of non trivial topological defects of codimension   and  of which the well known point charges and flux loops are special cases the complete algebraic structure of these defects defines a higher category and can be viewed as an emergent higher symmetry this plays a crucial role both in the classification of phases of matter and the possible fault tolerant logical operations in topological quantum error correcting codes in this paper we study several examples of such higher codimension defects from distinct perspectives we mainly study a class of invertible codimension topological defects which we refer to as twist strings we provide a number of general constructions for twist strings in terms of gauging lower dimensional invertible phases layer constructions and condensation defects we study some special examples in the context of gauge theory with fermionic charges in gauge theory with bosonic charges and also in non abelian discrete gauge theories based on dihedral  and alternating  groups the intersection between twist strings and abelian flux loops sources abelian point charges which defines an cohomology class that characterizes part of an underlying group symmetry of the topological order the equations involving background gauge fields for the group symmetry have been explicitly written down for various cases we also study examples of twist strings interacting with non abelian flux loops defining part of a non invertible higher symmetry examples of non invertible codimension defects and examples of interplay of codimension defects with codimension defects we also find an example of geometric not fully topological twist strings in d gauge theory\",\"this thesis consists of two parts both situated in operator theory and both motivated by the quest for rigorous quantizations of gauge theories the first part is based on skripkavn jst  van suijlekomvn jncg  and van suijlekomvn jhep  and concerns the spectral action of noncommutative geometry and its perturbative expansions we prove the existence of a higher order spectral shift function under the relative schatten class assumption give a converging series expansion of the spectral action in terms of chern simons and yang mills forms and show one loop renormalizability of the spectral action in a generalized sense the second part is based on stienstravn  and vn lmp  and concerns a non perturbative approach to quantum gauge theory by means of hamiltonian lattice gauge theory and strict quantization we construct c algebras of un gauge observables on the lattice show that they are conserved under the relevant time evolutions construct continuum limit c algebras and show that the result constitutes a strict deformation

 in more physical terms this space arises as the coulomb branch of pure gauge theory in three dimensions with gauge group  the langlands dual in the analogous formalism for describing chiral algebras of class  the vertex algebra associated to the sphere has been dubbed the emphchiral universal centraliser in this paper we construct an open symplectic embedding from a cover of the kostant toda lattice of type to the universal centraliser of  extending a classic result of kostant using this embedding and some observations on the poisson algebraic structure of  we propose a free field realisation of the chiral universal centraliser for any simple group  we exploit this realisation to develop free field realisations of chiral algebras of class of type for theories of genus zero with up to six punctures these realisations make generalised duality completely manifest and the generalisation to more than six punctures is conceptually clear though technically burdensome\",\"this is an introduction to noncommutative geometry from an algebraic and probabilistic viewpoint the spaces have no free analogues in the operator algebra sense but the corresponding unit spheres do have free analogues  there are many examples of real algebraic submanifolds  some of which are of riemannian flavor coming with a haar integration functional  that we will study here we will mostly focus on the free geometry but we will discuss as well some related geometries called easy completing the picture formed by the main geometries namely classicalfree realcomplex\",\"we discuss the notion of translation invariant vacua for d chiral algebras and relate it to the notion of the associated variety the two dimensional chiral algebra associated to four dimensional sym has a conjectural holographic dual involving the b model topological string theory we study the effect of non zero vacuum expectation values on the chiral algebra correlation functions and derive a holographic dual calabi yau geometry we test our proposal by a large analysis of correlation functions of determinant operators whose saddles can be matched with semi classical configurations of giant graviton d branes in the bulk\",\"we study the properties of d multiple d brane md system described by recently proposed complete supersymmetric and symmetric nonlinear action which includes an arbitrary positive definite function of the relative motion hamiltonian  first we show how the action with a particular nonlinear can be obtained from the action for d multiple m wave multiple m brane or mm system then we obtain the complete set of equations of motion of md system with arbitrary positive definite  perform a convenient gauge fixing solve the center of energy equations and establish an interesting correspondence between the relative motion md equations and the equations of maximal supersymmetric sun yang mills theory sym we show that this correspondence does not imply a gauge equivalence but establishes a relation between solutions of the system in particular it implies that all the supersymmetric solutions of md equations in its relative motion part coincide with supersymmetric solutions of the sym equations\",\"we investigate the trajectories of point charges in the background of finite action vacuum solutions of maxwells equations known as knot solutions more specifically we work with a basis of electromagnetic knots generated by the so called de sitter method we find a variety of behaviors depending on the field configuration and the parameter set used this includes an acceleration of particles by the electromagnetic field from rest to ultrarelativistic speeds a quick convergence of their trajectories into a few narrow cones asymptotically for sufficiently high value of the coupling and a pronounced twisting and turning of trajectories in a coherent fashion this work is part of an effort to improve the understanding of knotted electromagnetic fields and the trajectories of charged particles they generate and may be relevant for experimental applications\",\"this note is an extension of dz there the supersymmetric vacua of three dimensional gauge theories with matter are shown to be in one to one correspondence with the eigenstate of integrable spin chain hamiltonians with open boundary conditions we consider the quiver gauge theory which is the simplest non trivial quiver gauge theory and open spin chain with diagonal boundary condition we demonstrate the correspondence between the vacuum equations of different gauge groups and bethe ansatz equations with different boundary parameters not only that but we furthermore push forward the program to the general quiver gauge theory\",\"the kdv hierarchy is a paradigmatic example of the rich mathematical structure underlying integrable systems with far reaching connections in several areas of theoretical physics while the positive part of the kdv hierarchy is well known in this paper we propose an affine algebraic construction for its negative part we show that the original miura transformation can be extended to a gauge transformation that implies several new types of relation among the negative flows of the kdv and mkdv hierarchies contrary to the positive flows such a gauge miura correspondence becomes degenerate namely more than one negative mkdv type model are mapped into a single negative kdv type model for instance the sinh gordon model and another negative mkdv flow are mapped into a single negative kdv flow which then inherits solutions of both former models the gauge miura correspondence implies a rich degeneracy regarding solutions of these hierarchies we obtain similar results for generalized versions of the kdv and mkdv hiearchies constructed with the affine lie algebra  in this case the first negative mkdv flow corresponds to an affine toda field theory with scalar fields and the gauge miura correspondence yields its kdv counterpart for instance we show explicitly a kdv analog of the tzitzeica bullough dodd model in short we uncover a rich structure for the negative flows of integrable hierarchies yielding novel relations and integrable systems\",\"we explore connections among monstrous moonshine orbifolds the kitaev chain and topological modular forms symmetric orbifolds of the monster cft together

the data of generalized moonshine\",\"we develop the brst approach to construct the general off shell local lorentz covariant cubic interaction vertices for irreducible massive higher spin fields on dimensional minkowski space we consider two different cases for interacting higher spin fields with one massive and two massless with two massive both with coinciding and with different masses and one massless fields of spins  unlike the previous results on cubic vertices we follow our result in arxivhep th for massless fields and use the complete brst operator including the trace constraints that is used to formulate an irreducible representation with definite integer spin we generalize the cubic vertices proposed for reducible higher spin fields in arxiv hep th in the form of multiplicative and non multiplicative brst closed constituents and calculate the new contributions to the vertex which contain additional terms with a smaller number space time derivatives of the fields we prove that without traceless closeness conditions for the cubic vertices in arxiv hep th it is impossible to provide the noncontradictory lagrangian dynamics as the examples we explicitly construct the interacting lagrangian for the massive of spin field and massless scalars both with and without auxiliary fields the interacting models with different combinations of triples higher spin fields

multiplet of definite mass vanishes the same conclusion follows from the stone von neumann theorem in a quantum theory the constraint of an absolutely continuous spectrum to a lower dimensional submanifold yields zero even if diracs treatment of the corresponding classical constraint defines a symplectic submanifold with a consistent corresponding quantum model its hilbert space is not a subspace of the unconstrained theory hence the operator relations of the unconstrained model need not carry over to the constrained model our argument excludes quantized worldline models of relativistic particles and the physical states of the covariant quantum string we correct misconceptions about the generators of lorentz transformations acting on particles\",\"i consider pauli villars regulators for the ghosts in the path integral string formulation and show how they preserve conformal invariance i calculate the regulator contributions to the effective action and to the central charge and demonstrate the consistency of the mean field quantization of the nambu goto string in  the higher derivative corrections to the liouville action are briefly considered for the pauli villars and proper time regularizations\",\"the perturbative path integral gives a morphism of the quantum structure intrinsic to each quantum field theory which we show explicitly on the basis of the homological perturbation as is known in the bv formalism any effective action also solves the bv master equation which implies that the path integral can be understood as a morphism of the bv differential since each solution of the bv master equation is in one to one correspondence with a quantum structure the path integral preserves this intrinsic structure of quantum field theory where reduces to whenever multiplications of space time fields are graded commutative we apply these ideas to string field theory and re derive some quantities based on the perturbative path integral such as effective theories with finite  reduction of gauge and unphysical degrees matrix and gauge invariant observables\",\"it is known that local operators in quantum field theory transform in representations of ordinary global symmetry groups the purpose of this paper is to generalise this statement to extended operators such as line and surface defects we explain that dimensional operators transform in representations of a finite group symmetry and thoroughly explore this statement for  we therefore propose higher representation theory as the natural framework to describe the action of symmetries on the extended operator content in quantum field theory\",\"we consider a massless dirac field in dimensions and compute the tomita takesaki modular conjugation corresponding to the vacuum state and a generic multicomponent spacetime region we do it by analytic continuation from the modular flow which was computed recently we use our result to discuss the validity of haag duality in this model\",\"we consider a microscopic analogue of the bms analysis of asymptotic symmetries by analysing universal geometric structures on infinitesimal tangent light cones thereby two natural microscopic symmetry groups arise a non trivially represented lorentz group and a bms like group the latter has a rich mathematical structure since it contains the former as a non canonical subgroup next to infinitely many other lorentz subgroups none of those lorentz subgroups appears to be intrinsically preferred and hence the microscopic bms like group constitutes a natural symmetry group for infinitesimal tangent light cones we compare our investigation with the classical bms analysis and show that the microscopic bms like group is a gauge group for the bundle of null vectors motivated by the various applications of the original bms group our findings could have interesting implications they identify a geometric structure that could be suitable for a bulk analysis of gravitational waves they suggest a possible enlargement of the fundamental gauge group of gravity and they motivate the possibility of an interrelation between the uv structure of gauge theories gravitational memory effects and bms like symmetries also our results imply that bms like groups arise not only as macroscopic asymptotic symmetry groups in cosmology but describe also a fundamental and seemingly unknown microscopic symmetry of pseudo riemannian geometry\",\"we consider the twistor description of classical self dual einstein gravity in the presence of a defect operator wrapping a certain  the backreaction of this defect deforms the flat twistor space to that of eguchi hanson space we show that the celestial chiral algebra of self dual gravity on the eguchi hanson background is likewise deformed to become the loop algebra of a certain scaling limit of the family of algebras where the scaling limit is controlled by the radius of the eguchi hanson core we construct this algebra by computing the poisson algebra of holomorphic functions on the deformed twistor space and check this result with a space time calculation of the leading contribution to the gravitational splitting function the loop algebra of a general algebra away from the scaling limit similarly arises as the celestial chiral algebra of moyal deformed self dual gravity on eguchi hanson space we also obtain corresponding results for self dual yang mills\",\"we initiate the study of how the insertion of magnetically charged states in d self dual gauge theories impacts the d chiral algebras supported on the celestial sphere at asymptotic null infinity from the point of view of the dd twistorial correspondence introduced by costello and the second author by reducing the d twistorial theory to a d holomorphic topological theory with suitable boundary conditions we can motivate certain non perturbative enhancements of the celestial chiral algebra corresponding to extensions by modules arising from d boundary monopole operators we also identify the insertion of d non abelian monopoles with families of spectral flow automorphisms of the celestial chiral algebra\",\"the hilbert space of level chern simons theory of gauge group of the ade type quantized on can be represented by points that lie on the weight lattice of the lie algebra up to some discrete identifications of special significance are the points that also lie on the root lattice the generating functions that count the number of such points are quasi periodic ehrhart polynomials which coincide with the generating functions of representation of the ade subgroups of given by the mckay correspondence\",\"we continue the program of constructing premodular tensor categories from manifolds first initiated by cho gang kim using theory in physics and then mathematically studied by cui qiu wang an important structure involved is a collection of certain characters on a given manifold which serve as the simple object types in the corresponding category chern simons invariants and adjoint reidemeister torsions play a key role in the construction and they are related to topological twists and quantum dimensions respectively of simple objects the modular matrix is computed from local operators and follows a trial and error procedure it is currently unknown how to produce data beyond the modular and matrices there are also a number of subtleties in the construction which remain to be solved in this paper we consider an infinite family of manifolds that is torus bundles over the circle we show that the modular data produced by such manifolds are realized by the equivariantization of certain pointed premodular categories here the equivariantization is performed for the action sending a simple invertible object to its inverse also called the particle hole symmetry it is our hope that this extensive class of examples will shed light on how to improve the program to recover the full data of a premodular category\",\"we study a d gauge theory obtained from a theory by gauging a form symmetry  we show that this theory has a global continuous category symmetry whose structure is particularly rich for  this example allows us to draw a connection between the higher gauging procedure and the difference between local and global fusion which turns out to be a key feature of higher category symmetries by studying the spectrum of local and extended operators we find a mapping with gauge invariant operators of d yang mills theory the largest group like subcategory of the non invertible symmetries of our theory is a form symmetry acting on the wilson lines in the same way as the center symmetry of yang mills theory does supported by a path integral argument we propose that the gauge theory has a relation with the ultraviolet limit of yang mills theory in which all gukov witten operators become topological and form a continuous non invertible category symmetry broken down to the center symmetry by the rg flow\",\"an important problem in quantum field theory qft is to understand the structures of observables on spacetime manifolds of nontrivial topology such observables arise naturally when studying physical systems at finite temperature andor finite volume and encode subtle properties of the underlying microscopic theory that are often obscure on the flat spacetime locality of the qft implies that these observables can be constructed from more basic building blocks by cutting and gluing along a spatial slice where a crucial ingredient is the hilbert space on the spatial manifold in conformal field theory cft thanks to the operator state correspondence we have a non perturbative understanding of the hilbert space on a spatial sphere however it remains a challenge to consider more general spatial manifolds here we study cfts in spacetime dimensions on the spatial manifold which is one of the simplest manifolds beyond the spherical topology we focus on the ground state in this hilbert space and analyze universal properties of the ground state energy also commonly known as the casimir energy which is a nontrivial function of the complex structure moduli of the torus the casimir energy is subject to constraints from modular invariance on the torus which we spell out using spectral theory moreover we derive a simple universal formula for the casimir energy in the thin torus limit using the effective field theory eft from kaluza klein reduction of the cft with exponentially small corrections from worldline instantons we illustrate our formula with explicit examples from well known cfts including the critical model in and holographic cfts in \",\"we propose confining dualities of half bps boundary conditions in d supersymmetric  and gauge theories some of these dualities have the novel feature that one antifundamental chiral has dirichlet boundary condition while the rest have neumann boundary conditions while some of the dualities can be extended to d bulk dualities others should be understood intrinsically as d dualities as they seem to hold only at the boundary the gauge theory neumann half indices are well defined even for theories which contain monopole operators with non positive scaling dimensions and they are given by askey wilson type beta integrals as a consequence of the confining dualities new conjectural identities of such integrals are found\",\"we present the dictionary between the one particle hilbert spaces of totally symmetric tensor spinor fields of spin with any mass parameter on dimensional  de sitter space  and unitary irreducible representations uirs of the de sitter algebra spin our approach is based on expressing the eigenmodes on global in terms of eigenmodes of the dirac operator on the sphere which provides a natural way to identify the corresponding representations with known uirs under the decomposition spin spin remarkably we find that four dimensional de sitter space plays a distinguished role in the case of the gauge invariant theories in particular the strictly massless spin  field as well as the strictly and partially massless spin  fields on  are not unitary unless \",\"in this paper the well known relationship between theta functions and heisenberg group actions thereon is resumed by merging complex algebraic and noncommutative geometry in essence we describe hermitian einstein vector bundles on tori via representations of noncommutative tori thereby reconstructing matsushimas setup and making the ensuing fourier mukai nahm fmn aspects transparent we prove the existence of noncommutative torus actions on the space of smooth sections of hermitian einstein vector bundles on tori preserving the eigenspaces of a natural laplace operator motivated by the coherent state transform approach to theta functions we extend the latter to vector valued thetas and develop an additional algebraic reinterpretation of matsushimas theory making fmn duality manifest again\",\"we consider topological defect lines tdls in two dimensional fermionic conformal field theories cfts besides inheriting all the properties of tdls in bosonic cfts tdls in fermionic cfts could host fermionic defect operators at their endpoints and junctions furthermore there is a new type of tdls called q type tdls that have no analog in bosonic cfts their distinguishing feature is an extra one dimensional majorana fermion living on the worldline of the tdls the properties of tdls in fermionic cfts are captured in the mathematical language of the super fusion category we propose a classification of the rank super fusion categories generalizing the classification for the anomalies of symmetry we explicitly solve the f moves for all the nontrivial categories and derive the corresponding spin selection rules that constrain the spectrum of the defect operators we find the full set of tdls in the standard fermionic minimal models and a partial set of tdls in the two exceptional models which give cft realizations to the rank super fusion categories finally we discuss a constraint on the renormalization group flow that preserves a q type tdl\",\"we construct compact parametrix implementations of covariant derivations on the quantum annulus\",\"we generalize the notion of an anomaly for a symmetry to a noninvertible symmetry enacted by surface operators using the framework of condensation in categories given a multifusion category potentially with some additional levels of monoidality we prove theorems about the structure of the category obtained by condensing a suitable algebra object we give examples where the resulting category displays grouplike fusion rules and through a cohomology computation find the obstruction to condensing further to the vacuum theory\",\"for each complex semisimple group  moore and tachikawa conjectured the existence of a certain two dimensional topological quantum field theory whose target category has complex lie groups as objects and holomorphic symplectic varieties with hamiltonian actions of the groups as morphisms the conjecture is motivated by string theory where is obtained by taking the higgs branch of some supersymmetric quantum field theories called theories of class  depending on and a riemann surface the goal of this paper is to define a real analogue of the target category and to rigorously prove that it is a category\",\"the divergence free and gamma traceless vector spinor eigenfunctions as well as the divergence free and gamma traceless rank symmetric tensor spinor eigenfunctions of the dirac operator on the sphere  are written down explicitly for  the spin  and spin  eigenmodes of the dirac operator with arbitrary imaginary mass parameter on dimensional  de sitter spacetime  are obtained by analytic continuation their transformation properties under the de sitter algebra spin are studied for odd we show that there is no de sitter ds invariant scalar product for these eigenmodes for even although ds invariant scalar products exist positive definiteness of the norm occurs only for the strictly and partially massless theories in dimensions for  the way in which the eigenmodes form unitary strictly and partially massless representations of spin is emphasised the analysis presented in this paper reveals previously unknown features of the gauge invariant theories with spin  and  on  the strictly massless spin  field theory as well as the strictly and partially massless spin  field theories are unitary only for  in particular a unitary theory for the gravitino field on does not exist unless \",\"three geometric formulations of the hamiltonian structure of the macroscopic maxwell equations are given one in terms of the double de rham complex one in terms of l duality and one utilizing an abstract notion of duality the final of these is used to express the geometric and hamiltonian structure of kinetic theories in general media the poisson bracket so stated is explicitly metric free finally as a special case the lorentz covariance of such kinetic theories is investigated we obtain a lorentz covariant kinetic theory coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics such as born infeld or euler heisenberg electrodynamics\",\"we discuss invertible and non invertible topological condensation defects arising from gauging a discrete higher form symmetry on a higher codimensional manifold in spacetime which we define as higher gauging a form symmetry is called gaugeable if it can be gauged on a codimension manifold in spacetime we focus on gaugeable form symmetries in general d qft and gauge them on a surface in spacetime the universal fusion rules of the resulting invertible and non invertible condensation surfaces are determined in the special case of d tqft every invertible and non invertible form global symmetry including the electromagnetic symmetry of the gauge theory is realized from higher gauging we further compute the fusion rules between the surfaces the bulk lines and lines that only live on the surfaces determining some of the most basic data for the underlying fusion category we emphasize that the fusion coefficients in these non invertible fusion rules are generally not numbers but rather d tqfts finally we discuss examples of non invertible symmetries in non topological d qfts such as the free maxwell theory and qed\",\"by using the solvability of lauricella function with nonpositive integer  we show that each scattering or decay process of string and d brane states at textitarbitrary mass levels can be expressed in terms of a single lauricella function this result extends the previous exact symmetry of tree level open bosonic string theory to include the d brane\",\"we prove a precise form of ads bulk locality by deriving analytical two sided bounds on bulk wilson coefficients our bounds are on the wilson coefficients themselves rather than their ratios as is typically found in the literature inspired by the celestial amplitudes program in flat space we perform a celestial transform of the cft mellin amplitude of four identical scalars using the crossing symmetric dispersion relation csdr we express the resulting amplitude in terms of crossing symmetric conformal partial waves the partial waves satisy remarkable positivity properties which along with the unitarity of the cft prove sufficient to derive the bounds we then employ our methods in the limit of large ads radius and recover known bounds on flat space wilson coefficients and new bounds on their large radius corrections we check that the planar mellin amplitude of four stress tensor multiplets in sym satisfies our bounds finally using null constraints we derive a form of low spin dominance in ads efts we find that the low spin dominance is strongest in flat space and weakens as we move away from flat space towards higher ads curvature\",\"we study the holomorphic twist of d n  supersymmetric field theories discuss the perturbative bulk local operators in general and explicitly construct non perturbative bulk local operators for abelian gauge theories our construction is verified by matching the character of the algebra with the superconformal index we test a conjectural relation between the derived center of boundary algebras and bulk algebras in various cases including landau ginzburg models with an arbitrary superpotential and some abelian gauge theories in the latter cases monopole operators appear in the derived center of a perturbative boundary algebra we briefly discuss the higher structures in both boundary and bulk algebras\",\"we develop the holographic dictionary for pure gravity where the lagrangian of the dual conformal field theory has been deformed by an arbitrary function of the energy momentum tensor in addition to the deformation examples of such functions include a class of marginal stress tensor deformations which are special because they leave the generating functional of connected correlators unchanged up to a redefinition of the source and expectation value within this marginal class we identify the unique deformation that commutes with the flow which is the root operator and write down the modified boundary conditions corresponding to this root deformation we also identify the unique marginal stress tensor flow for the cylinder spectrum of the dual cft which commutes with the inviscid burgers flow driven by  and we propose this unique flow as a candidate root deformation of the energy levels we study btz black holes in subject to root deformed boundary conditions and find that their masses flow in a way which is identical to that of our candidate root energy flow equation which offers evidence that this flow is the correct one finally we also obtain the root deformed boundary conditions for the gauge field in the chern simons formulation of gravity\",\"this paper represents the second in a series of works aimed at reinvigorating the quantum geometrodynamics program our approach introduces a hilbert space at each lattice site along with the corresponding representation of the conventional commutation relations and which manifestly realizes the positive definiteness of the spatial metric even in the quantum theory to achieve this end we resort to the cholesky decomposition of the spatial metric into upper triangular matrices with positive diagonal entries moreover our hilbert space also carries a representation of the vielbein fields and naturally separates the physical and gauge degrees of freedom finally we introduce a generalization of the weyl quantization for our representation we also emphasize that our proposed methodology is amenable to applications in other fields of physics particularly in scenarios where the configuration space is restricted by complicated relationships among the degrees of freedom\",\"we introduce a framework for internal topological symmetries in quantum field theory including noninvertible symmetries and categorical symmetries this leads to a calculus of topological defects which takes full advantage of well developed theorems and techniques in topological field theory our discussion focuses on finite symmetries and we give indications for a generalization to other symmetries we treat quotients and quotient defects often called gauging and condensation defects finite electromagnetic duality and duality defects among other topics we include an appendix on finite homotopy theories which are often used to encode finite symmetries and for which computations can be carried out using methods of algebraic topology throughout we emphasize exposition and examples over a detailed technical treatment\",\"when studying quantum field theories and lattice models it is often useful to analytically continue the number of field or spin components from an integer to a real number in spite of this the precise meaning of such analytic continuations has never been fully clarified and in particular the symmetry of these theories is obscure we clarify these issues using deligne categories and their associated brauer algebras and show that these provide logically satisfactory answers to these questions simple objects of the deligne category generalize the notion of an irreducible representations avoiding the need for such mathematically nonsensical notions as vector spaces of non integer dimension we develop a systematic theory of categorical symmetries applying it in both perturbative and non perturbative contexts a partial list of our results is categorical symmetries are preserved under rg flows continuous categorical symmetries come equipped with conserved currents cfts with categorical symmetries are necessarily non unitary\",\"this paper provides a systematic study of gauge symmetries in the dynamical fuzzy spectral triple models for quantum gravity that have been proposed by barrett and collaborators we develop both the classical and the perturbative quantum bv formalism for these models which in particular leads to an explicit homological construction of the perturbative quantum correlation functions we show that the relevance of ghost and antifield contributions to such correlation functions depends strongly on the background dirac operator around which one perturbs and in particular on the amount of gauge symmetry that it breaks this will be illustrated by studying quantum perturbations around  the gauge invariant zero dirac operator in a general model and  a simple example of a non trivial in the quartic model\",\"given any symmetry acting on a dimensional quantum field theory there is an associated dimensional topological field theory known as the symmetry tft symtft the symtft is useful for decoupling the universal quantities of quantum field theories such as their generalized global symmetries and t hooft anomalies from their dynamics in this work we explore the symtft for theories with kramers wannier like duality symmetry in both d and d quantum field theories after constructing the symtft we use it to reproduce the non invertible fusion rules of duality defects and along the way we generalize the concept of duality defects to textithigher duality defects we also apply the symtft to the problem of distinguishing intrinsically versus non intrinsically non invertible duality defects in d\",\"we study the braided tensor structure of line operators in the topological a and b twists of abelian d gauge theories as accessed via boundary vertex operator algebras voas we focus exclusively on abelian theories we first find a non perturbative completion of boundary voas in the b twist which start out as certain affine lie superalebras and we construct free field realizations of both a and b twist voas finding an interesting interplay with the symmetry fractionalization group of bulk theories we use the free field realizations to establish an isomorphism between a and b voas related by d mirror symmetry turning to line operators we extend previous physical classifications of line operators to include new monodromy defects and bound states we also outline a mechanism by which continuous global symmetries in a physical theory are promoted to higher symmetries in a topological twist in our case these are infinite one form symmetries related to boundary spectral flow which structure the categories of lines and control abelian gauging finally we establish the existence of braided tensor structure on categories of line operators viewed as non semisimple categories of modules for boundary voas in the a twist we obtain the categories by extending modules of symplectic boson voas corresponding to gauging free hypermultiplets in the b twist we instead extend kazhdan lusztig categories for affine lie superalgebras we prove braided tensor equivalences among the categories of d mirror theories all results on voas and their module categories are mathematically rigorous they rely strongly on recently developed techniques to access non semisimple extensions\",\"we study the boundary vertex algebras of twisted abelian gauge theories in three dimensions these are identified with the brst quotient semi infinite cohomology of collections of symplectic bosons and free fermions that reflect the matter content of the corresponding gauge theory we develop various free field realisations for these vertex algebras which we propose to interpret in terms of their localisation on their associated varieties we derive the free field realisations by bosonising the elementary symplectic bosons and free fermions and then calculating the relevant semi infinite cohomology which can be done systematically an interesting feature of our construction is that for certain preferred free field realisations the outer automorphism symmetry of the vertex algebras in question which are identified with the symmetries of the coulomb branch in the infrared are made manifest\",\"we present a new supersymmetric index for three dimensional gauge theories defined on  where is a spindle with twist or anti twist for the symmetry background gauge field we start examining general supersymmetric backgrounds of euclidean new minimal supergravity admitting two killing spinors of opposite charges we then focus on and demostrate how to realise twist and anti twist we compute the supersymmetric partition functions on such backgrounds via localization and show that these are captured by a general formula depending on the type of twist which unifies and generalises the superconformal and topologically twisted indices\",\"we quantize jt gravity with matter on the spatial interval with two asymptotically ads boundaries we consider the von neumann algebra generated by the right hamiltonian and the gravitationally dressed matter operators on the right boundary we prove that the commutant of this algebra is the analogously defined left boundary algebra and that both algebras are type ii factors these algebras provide a precise notion of the entanglement wedge away from the semiclassical limit we comment on how the factorization problem differs between pure jt gravity and jt gravity with matter\",\"we discuss the quantum poincare symmetries of the minkowski spacetime a space characterised by an angular form of noncommutativity we show that it is possible to give them both a bicrossproduct and a drinfeld twist structure we also obtain a new noncommutative product which is cyclic with respect to the standard integral measure\",\"in this paper we revise the concept of noncommutative vector fields introduced previously in ref  extending the framework adding new results and clarifying the old ones using appropriate algebraic tools certain shortcomings in the previous considerations are filled and made more precise we focus on the correspondence between so called cartan pairs and first order differentials the case of free bimodules admitting more friendly coordinate description and their braiding is considered in more detail bimodules of rightleft universal vector fields are explicitly constructed\",\"we study the double scaling limit of syk ds syk model and elucidate the underlying quantum group symmetry the ds syk model is characterized by a parameter  and in the and low energy limit it goes over to the familiar schwarzian theory we relate the chord and transfer matrix picture to the motion of a boundary particle on the euclidean poincare disk which underlies the single sided schwarzian model carries an action of  and we argue that the symmetry of the full ds syk model is a certain deformation of the latter namely  we do this by obtaining the effective hamiltonian of the ds syk as a reduction of particle moving on a lattice deformation of  which has this algebra as its symmetry we also exhibit the connection to non commutative geometry of homogeneous spaces by obtaining the effective hamiltonian of the ds syk as a reduction of particle moving on a non commutative deformation of  there are families of possibly distinct deformed spaces and we point out which are relevant for the ds syk model\",\"we prove that semisimple dimensional oriented topological field theories lead to stable diffeomorphism invariants and can therefore not distinguish homeomorphic closed oriented smooth manifolds and homotopy equivalent simply connected closed oriented smooth manifolds we show that all currently known dimensional field theories are semisimple including unitary field theories and once extended field theories which assign algebras or linear categories to manifolds as an application we compute the value of a semisimple field theory on a simply connected closed oriented manifold in terms of its euler characteristic and signature moreover we show that a semisimple dimensional field theory is invariant under stable diffeomorphisms if and only if the gluck twist acts trivially this may be interpreted as the absence of fermions amongst the point particles of the field theory such fermion free field theories cannot distinguish homotopy equivalent manifolds throughout we illustrate our results with the crane yetter kauffman field theory associated to a ribbon fusion category as an algebraic corollary of our results applied to this field theory we show that a ribbon fusion category contains a fermionic object if and only if its gauss sums vanish\",\"we consider d theories on the geometry  where is a closed and connected riemann surface from the point of view of a quantum mechanics on  focussing on the elementary mirror pair in the presence of real deformation parameters namely sqed with one hypermultiplet sqed and the free hypermulitplet we study the algebras of local operators in the respective quantum mechanics as well as their action on the vector space of supersymmetric ground states we demonstrate that the algebras can be described in terms of heisenberg algebras and that they act in a way reminiscent of segal bargmann b twist of the free hypermultiplet and nakajima a twist of sqed operators\",\"chiral higher spin gravity is the minimal extension of the graviton with propagating massless higher spin fields it admits any value of the cosmological constant including zero its existence implies that chern simons vector models have closed subsectors and supports the bosonization duality in this letter we explicitly construct an algebra that determines all interaction vertices of the theory the algebra turns out to be of pre calabi yau type the corresponding products some of which originate from shoikhet tsygan kontsevich formality are given by integrals over the configuration space of convex polygons\",\"we construct quantum geometrically realised spectral triples or dirac operators on the noncommutative torus with its standard quantum metric and on the algebra of matrices with two standard quantum metrics and associated quantum levi civita connections we derive the required form of clifford algebra and spinor bundle connection compatible with the quantum riemannian geometry in the case of the noncommutative torus we obtain a standard even spectral triple but now uniquely determined by geometric realisability in the case of  one metric with its flat quantum levi civita connection results in a natural even spectral triple the other metric has a lorentzian signature and we show that it admits a natural parameter almost spectral triple where the dirac operator is neither hermitian nor antihermitian in general and the quantum levi civita connection is curved in all cases we split the construction into a local tensorial part related to the quantum geometry where we classify the results more broadly and the further requirements relating to the hilbert space structure\",\"this is a brief reminder with extensions from a different angle and for a less specialized audience of my presentation at wgmp in july  to which i refer for more details on the topics hinted at in the title mainly deformation theory applied to quantization and symmetries of elementary particles\",\"we initiate the construction of integrable deformed wzw models based on non semisimple groups we focus on the four dimensional case whose underlying symmetries are based on the non semisimple group  the corresponding gravitational backgrounds of lorentzian signature are plane waves which can be obtained as penrose limits of the deformed background times a timelike coordinate for appropriate choices of the matrix we construct two such deformations which we demonstrate to be integrable they both deform the nappi witten plane wave and are inequivalent nevertheless they have the same underlying symmetry algebra which is a saletan type contraction of that for the deformed background with a timelike direction we also construct a plane wave from the penrose limit of the deformation of the coset cft times a timelike coordinate which represents the deformation of a logarithmic cft constructed in the past finally we briefly consider contractions based on the simplest yang baxter models\",\"we introduce an unrolled quantization of the complex lie superalgebra and use its categories of weight modules to construct and study new three dimensional non semisimple topological quantum field theories these theories are defined on categories of cobordisms which are decorated by ribbon graphs and cohomology classes and take values in categories of graded super vector spaces computations in these theories are enabled by a detailed study of the representation theory of  both for generic and root of unity  we argue that by restricting to subcategories of integral weight modules we obtain topological quantum field theories which are mathematical models of chern simons theories with gauge supergroups and coupled to background flat connections as studied in the physics literature by rozansky saleur and mikhaylov in particular we match verlinde formulae and mapping class group actions on state spaces of non generic tori with results in the physics literature we also obtain explicit descriptions of state spaces of generic surfaces including their graded dimensions which go beyond results in the physics literature\",\"the hodge dual operator recently introduced for supermanifolds is used to reformulate super yang mills and supergravity in  we first recall the definition of the hodge dual operator for flat and curved supermanifolds then we show how to recover the usual super yang mills equations of motion for supersymmetry and the obstacles as seen from hodge dual point of view in the case  we reconsider several ingredients of supergeometry relevant for a superspace formulation of supergravity in terms of the hodge dual operator finally we discuss how and supergravity is obtained in this framework\",\"we formulate a notion of jet bundles over a possibly noncommutative algebra equipped with a torsion free connection among the conditions needed for rd order jets and above is that the connection also be flat and its generalised braiding tensor obey the yang baxter equation or braid relations we also cover the case of jet bundles of a given vector bundle over in the form of a bimodule with a flat bimodule connection with its braiding obeying the coloured braid relations examples include the permutation group with its cycles calculus  the bicrossproduct model quantum spacetime in two dimensions and for a th root of unity\",\"quantization of the teichmuller space of a punctured riemann surface is an approach to dimensional quantum gravity and is a prototypical example of quantization of cluster varieties any simple loop in gives rise to a natural trace of monodromy function on the teichmuller space for any ideal triangulation of  this function is a laurent polynomial in the square roots of the exponentiated shear coordinates for the arcs of  an important problem was to construct a quantization of this function  namely to replace it by a noncommutative laurent polynomial in the quantum variables this problem which is closely related to the framed protected spin characters in physics has been solved by allegretti and kim using bonahon and wongs quantum trace for skein algebras and by gabella using gaiotto moore and neitzkes seiberg witten curves spectral networks and writhe of links we show that these two solutions to the quantization problem coincide we enhance gabellas solution and show that it is a twist of the bonahon wong quantum trace\",\"we find a large internal symmetry within dimensional poincare gauge theory in the riemann cartan geometry of poincare gauge theory the field equation and geodesics are invariant under projective transformation just as in affine geometry however in the riemann cartan case the torsion and nonmetricity tensors change by generalizing the riemann cartan geometry to allow both torsion and nonmetricity while maintaining local lorentz symmetry the difference of the antisymmetric part of the nonmetricity q and the torsion t is a projectively invariant linear combination with the same symmetry as torsion the structure equations may be written entirely in terms of s and the corresponding riemann cartan curvature the new description of the geometry has manifest projective and lorentz symmetries and vanishing nonmetricity torsion s and q lie in the vector space of vector valued forms within the extended geometry we define rotations with axis in the direction of s these rotate both torsion and nonmetricity while leaving s invariant in n dimensions and p q signature this gives a large internal symmetry the four dimensional case acquires so or spin internal symmetry sufficient for the standard model the most general action up to linearity in second derivatives of the solder form now includes combinations quadratic in torsion and nonmetricity torsion nonmetricity couplings and the einstein hilbert action imposing projective invariance reduces this to dependence on s and curvature alone the new internal symmetry decouples from gravity in agreement with the coleman mandula theorem\",\"we study chiral algebra in the reduction of d supersymmetric gauge theories on an interval with the dirichlet boundary conditions on both ends by invoking the d twisted formalism and the d description we explicitly find the perturbative cohomology of the reduced theory it is shown that the vertex algebras of boundary operators are enhanced by the line operators a full non perturbative result is found in the abelian case where the chiral algebra is given by the rank two narain lattice voa and two more equivalent descriptions are provided conjectures and speculations on the nonperturbative answer in the non abelian case are also given\",\"we address the problem of uvir mixing in noncommutative quantum field theories from the perspective of braided structures and the batalin vilkovisky formalism we describe the example of braided noncommutative scalar field theory and its quantization using braided homological perturbation theory the formalism is illustrated through one loop calculations of the two point functions for theory in four dimensions and theory in six dimensions in both cases we find that there are no non planar diagrams and no uvir mixing\",\"we use the language of categorical condensation to give a procedure for gauging nonabelian anyons which are the manifestations of categorical symmetries in three spacetime dimensions we also describe how the condensation procedure can be used in other contexts such as for topological cosets and constructing modular invariants by studying a generalization of which anyons are condensable we arrive at representations of congruence subgroups of the modular group we finally present an analysis for ungauging anyons which is related to the problem of constructing a drinfeld center for a fusion category this procedure we refer to as bulk reconstruction we introduce a set of consistency relations regarding lines in the parent theory and wall category through use of these relations along with the matrix elements of the child theory we construct matrix elements of a parent theory in a number of examples\",\"the relationship between symmetry fields and first integrals of divergence free vector fields is explored in three dimensions in light of its relevance to plasma physics and magnetic confinement fusion a noether type theorem is known for each such symmetry there corresponds a first integral the extent to which the converse is true is investigated in doing so a reformulation of this noether type theorem is found for which the converse holds on what is called the toroidal region some consequences of the methods presented are quick proofs of the existence of flux coordinates for magnetic fields in high generality without needing to assume a symmetry such as in the cases of magneto hydrostatics mhs or quasi symmetry\",\"the homotopy algebraic formalism of braided noncommutative field theory is used to define the explicit example of braided electrodynamics that is gauge theory minimally coupled to a dirac fermion we construct the braided algebra of this field theory and obtain the braided equations of motion action functional and conserved matter current the modifications of the electric charge conservation law due to the braided noncommutative deformation are described we develop a braided generalization of wicks theorem and use it to compute correlation functions of the braided quantum field theory using homological perturbation theory although the braided theory does not contain the non planar feynman diagrams of conventional noncommutative quantum field theory we find that some correlators nevertheless exhibit uvir mixing\",\"scalar vector and tensor conserved quantities are essential tools in solving different problems in physics and complex nonlinear differential equations in mathematics in many guises they enter our understanding of nature charge lepton baryon numbers conservation accompanied with constant energy linear or angular total momenta and the conservation of energy momentumangular momentum tensors in field theories due to noether theorem which is based on the translational and lorentz symmetry of the lagrangians one of the oldest discovered conserved quantities is the laplace runge lenz vector for the potential its different aspects have been discussed many times in the literature but explicit generalisations to other spherically symmetric potentials are still rare here we attempt to fill this gap by constructing explicit examples of a conserved vector perpendicular to the angular momentum for a class of phenomenologically relevant potentials hereby we maintain the nomenclature and keep calling these constant vectors laplace runge lenz vectors\",\"the purpose of this paper is to discuss a number of issues that crop up in the computation of poisson brackets in field theories this is specially important for the canonical approaches to quantization and in particular for loop quantum gravity we illustrate the main points by working out several examples due attention is paid to relevant analytic issues that are unavoidable in order to properly understand how computations should be carried out although the functional spaces that we use throughout the paper will likely have to be modified in order to deal with specific physical theories such as general relativity many of the points that we will raise will also be relevant in that context the specific example of the mock holonomy flux algebra will be considered in some detail and used to draw some conclusions regarding the loop quantum gravity formalism\",\"we discover a stringy scaling behavior for a class of n point regge string scattering amplitudes rssa the number of independent kinematics variables is found to be reduced by dim m\",\"symmetries and their applications always played an important role in ie segals work i shall exemplify this starting with his correct proof at the lie group level of what physicists call the oraifeartaigh theorem continuing with his incidental introduction in of the  inonu wigner contractions of which the passage from ads so to poincare is an important example and with his interest in conformal groups in the latter part of last century since the s flato and i had many fruitful interactions with him around these topics in a last section i succinctly relate these interests in symmetries with several of ours especially elementary particles symmetries and deformation quantization and with an ongoing program combining both\",\"the generators of unitary representations of the poincare group generate an algebra which maps smooth wavefunctions to smooth wavefunctions this mathematical result is highly welcome to physicists who previously just assumed their algebraic treatment of unbounded operators be justified the smoothness however has the side effect that rough operators which map smooth wavefunctions to functions which are not smooth are inconsistent with poincare symmetry their product with the generators cannot be defined rough and smooth operators are not members of a common algebra transverse heisenberg pairs and    which commute with  as they occur in the light cone string act roughly on massless multiplets the domain of their algebra is not mapped to itself by rotations leave alone lorentz transformations this is true in all dimensions and makes the algebraic calculation of the critical dimension  of the bosonic string meaningless in no dimension does the light cone string admit a unitary representation of the lorentz group massless multiplets are inconsistent with a spatial position operator  which generates translations of the spatial momentum\",\"new fundamental physical theories can so far a posteriori be seen as emerging from existing ones via some kind of deformation that is the basis for flatos deformation philosophy of which the main paradigms are the physics revolutions from the beginning of the twentieth century quantum mechanics via deformation quantization and special relativity on the basis of these facts we describe two main directions by which symmetries of hadrons strongly interacting elementary particles may emerge by deforming in some sense including quantization the anti de sitter symmetry ads itself a deformation of the poincare group of special relativity the ultimate goal is to base on fundamental principles the dynamics of strong interactions which originated half a century ago from empirically guessed internal symmetries after a rapid presentation of the physical hadrons and mathematical deformation theory contexts we review a possible explanation of photons as composites of ads singletons in a way compatible with qed and of leptons as similar composites massified by higgs extending the electroweak model to generations then we present a model generating multifaceted framework in which ads would be deformed and quantized possibly at root of unity andor in manner not yet mathematically developed with noncommutative parameters that would give using deformations a space time origin to the internal symmetries of elementary particles on which their dynamics were based and either question or give a conceptually solid base to the standard model in line with einsteins

statistics in one and two spacetime dimensions our answers can be naturally expressed in terms of an internal fermionic symmetry group which is different from the spacetime structure group fermionic groups encode symmetries of systems with fermions and time reversing symmetries we show that dimensional topological field theories with reflection structure and spin statistics are classified by finite dimensional hermitian representations of  in spacetime dimension two we give a classification in terms strongly graded stellar frobenius algebras our proofs are based on the cobordism hypothesis along the way we develop some useful tools for the computation of homotopy fixed points of group actions on bicategories\",\"we study four dimensional gauge theories in the context of an equivariant extension of the batalin vilkovisky bv formalism we discuss the embedding of bv yang mills ym theory into a larger bv theory and their relation partial integration in the equivariant bv setting bv push forward map is performed explicitly for the abelian case as result we obtain a non local homological generalization of the cartan calculus and a non local extension of the abelian ym bv action which satisfies the equivariant master equation\",\"we construct a canonical geometrically realised connes spectral triple or dirac operator from the data of a quantum metric and quantum levi civita bimodule connection at the pre hilbert space level here is a possibly noncommutative coordinate algebra a bimodule of forms and the spinor bundle is  when applied to graphs or lattices we essentially recover a dirac operator previously proposed by bianconi but now as a geometrically realised spectral triple we also apply the construction to the fuzzy sphere and to matrices with their standard quantum riemannian geometries we also propose how can be minimally coupled to an external potential\",\"we use the theory of topological modular forms to constrain bosonic holomorphic cfts which can be viewed as scfts with trivial right moving supersymmetric sector a conjecture by segal stolz and teichner requires the constant term of the partition function to be divisible by specific integers determined by the central charge we verify this constraint in large classes of physical examples and rule out the existence of an infinite set of extremal cfts including those with central charges and \",\"the theory of topological modular forms tmf predicts that elliptic genera of physical theories satisfy a certain divisibility property determined by the theorys gravitational anomaly in this note we verify this prediction in duncans supermoonshine module as well as in tensor products and orbifolds thereof along the way we develop machinery for computing the elliptic genera of general alternating orbifolds and discuss the relation of this construction to the elusive periodicity class of tmf\",\"we consider several topologically twisted chern simons matter theories and propose boundary voas whose module categories should model the category of line operators of the d bulk our main examples come from the topological and twists of the exotic chern simons matter theories of gaiotto witten but we show that there is a topological  twist for a much larger class of theories we illustrate a particular example of this new class of theories that admits the singlet voa on its boundary and comment on its relation to the limit of the gaiotto rapv cak corner voa \",\"classical chern simons theory assigns a manifold with representation its complex volume  with real part the volume and imaginary part the chern simons invariant the existing literature focuses on computing using a triangulation in this paper we show how to compute directly from a surgery diagram

approach for the deformation procedure in the case of reducible gauge theories lavrov in eur phys j c   it is shown that in the model of massless spin field and a real scalar field local cubic and quartic vertices invariant under original gauge transformations can be explicitly constructed\",\"a decade ago it was shown that associated with any model for duality invariant nonlinear electrodynamics there is a unique duality invariant supersymmetric nonlinear sigma model formulated in terms of chiral and complex linear superfields here we study the superconformal model analogue of the conformal duality invariant electrodynamics known as the modmax theory we derive its dual formulation in terms of chiral superfields and show that the target space is a kahler cone with being the connected component of the isometry group\",\"this work examines the deformed fuzzy sphere as an example of a fuzzy space that can be described through a spectral triple using computer visualisations we first explore this geometry using an analytic expression for the eigenvalues to examine the spectral dimension and volume of the geometry in the second part of the paper we extend the code from our past work with abel stern in which the truncated sphere was visualized through localized states this generalisation allows us to examine finite spectral triples in particular we apply this code to the deformed fuzzy sphere as a first step in the more ambitious program of using it to examine arbitrary finite spectral triples like those generated from random fuzzy spaces\",\"gravitational subsystems with boundaries carry the action of an infinite dimensional symmetry algebra with potentially profound implications for the quantum theory of gravity we initiate an investigation into the quantization of this corner symmetry algebra for the phase space of gravity localized to a region bounded by a dimensional sphere starting with the observation that the algebra of area preserving diffeomorphisms of the sphere admits a deformation to the finite dimensional algebra  we derive novel finite deformations for two important subalgebras of the gravitational corner symmetry algebra specifically we find that the area preserving hydrodynamical algebra arises as the large limit of and that the full area preserving corner symmetry algebra is the large limit of the pseudo unitary group  we find matching conditions for the casimir elements of the deformed and continuum algebras and show how these determine the value of the deformation parameter as well as the representation of the deformed algebra associated with a quantization of the local gravitational phase space additionally we present a number of novel results related to the various algebras appearing including a detailed analysis of the asymptotic expansion of the structure constants as well as an explicit computation of the full structure constants in the spherical harmonic basis a consequence of our work is the definition of an area operator which is compatible with the deformation of the area preserving corner symmetry at finite \",\"we propose new holonomy manifolds which geometrize the gaiotto kim d n duality domain walls of d n theories these domain walls interpolate between different extended coulomb branch phases of a given d superconformal field theory our starting point is the geometric realization of such a d superconformal field theory and its extended coulomb branch in terms of m theory on a non compact singular calabi yau three fold and its kahler cone we construct the manifold that realizes the domain wall in m theory by fibering the calabi yau three fold over a real line whilst varying its kahler parameters as prescribed by the domain wall construction in particular this requires the calabi yau fiber to pass through a canonical singularity at the locus of the domain wall due to the d n supersymmetry that is preserved on the domain wall we expect the resulting manifold to have holonomy  indeed for simple domain wall theories this construction results in manifolds which are known to admit torsion free holonomy metrics we develop several generalizations to new manifolds which realize domain walls in d sqcd theories and walls between d theories which are uv dual\",\"we consider the topological stringspectral theory duality on toric calabi yau threefolds obtained from the resolution of the cone over the singularity assuming kyiv formula we demonstrate this duality in a special regime thanks to an underlying connection between spectral determinants of quantum mirror curves and the non autonomous q toda system we further exploit this link to connect small and large time expansions in toda equations in particular we provide an explicit expression for their tau functions at large time in terms of a strong coupling version of irregular conformal blocks at  these are related to a special class of multi cut matrix models which describe the strong coupling regime of four dimensional super yang mills\",\"the majorana transformation makes it possible to reduce the thomas fermi equation to a first order differential equation this reduction is possible due to the special scaling property of the thomas fermi equation under homology transformations such reductions are well known in the context of stellar astrophysics where the use of homology invariant variables has long proved useful we use homology invariant variables in the context of the thomas fermi equation to demystify the origin of the otherwise mysterious majorana transformation\",\"we compute all worldsheet three point functions involving spectrally flowed operators in chiral multiplets of the space time theory for strings in adsst thus completing the analysis of the full adscft chiral ring we make use of techniques recently developed for the bosonic sector based on holomorphic covering maps from the worldsheet to the ads boundary we highlight the role of the so called series identifications when dealing with the complications originated by picture changing spectrally flowed states we find an exact agreement with the predictions from the holographic cft at the symmetric orbifold point including both extremal and non extremal correlators\",\"recently we calculated the contribution of leutwyler zero mode chromons to the yang mills effective lagrangian by integrating over collective coordinates of the nonlinearly interacting zero modes here we analyse the behaviour of the partition function prefactor and the integration measure jacobian of the zero modes and show that these factors do not contribute to the effective lagrangian\",\"we consider a poisson gauge theory with a generic poisson structure of lie algebraic type we prove an important identity which allows to obtain simple and manifestly gauge covariant expressions for the euler lagrange equations of motion the bianchi and the noether identities we discuss the non lagrangian equations of motion and apply our findings to the minkowski case we construct a family of exact solutions of the deformed maxwell equations in the vacuum in the classical limit these solutions recover plane waves with left handed and right handed circular polarization being classical counterparts of photons the deformed dispersion relation appears to be nontrivial\",\"we propose a functional measure over the torsion tensor we discuss two completely equivalent choices for the wheeler dewitt supermetric for this field the first one being based on its algebraic decomposition the other inspired by teleparallel theories of gravity the measure is formally defined by requiring the normalization of the gaussian integral to achieve such a result we split the torsion tensor into its spin parity eigenstates by constructing a new york like decomposition of course such a decomposition has a wider range of applicability to any kind of tensor sharing the symmetries of the torsion as a result of this procedure a functional jacobian naturally arises whose formal expression is given exactly in the phenomenologically interesting limit of maximally symmetric spaces we also discuss the explicit computation of this jacobian in the case of a dimensional sphere with particular emphasis on its logarithmic divergences\",\"we present a numerical approximation scheme for the tomita takesaki modular operator of local subalgebras in linear quantum fields working at one particle level this is applied to the local subspaces for double cones in the vacuum sector of a massive scalar free field in    and    dimensional minkowski spacetime using a discretization of time data in position space in the case of a wedge region one component of the modular generator is well known to be a mass independent multiplication operator our results strongly suggest that for the double cone the corresponding component is still at least close to a multiplication operator but that it is dependent on mass and angular momentum\",\"we develop a nonlinear realisation approach to topologically massive supergravity in three dimensions with and without a cosmological term it is a natural generalisation of a similar construction for supergravity in four dimensions which was recently proposed by one of us at the heart of both formulations is the nonlinear realisation approach to gravity which was given by volkov and soroka fifty years ago in the context of spontaneously broken local supersymmetry in our setting the action for cosmological topologically massive supergravity is invariant under two different local supersymmetries one of them acts on the goldstino while the other supersymmetry leaves the goldstino invariant the former can be used to gauge away the goldstino and then the resulting action coincides with that given in the literature\",\"we present a generalisation of the embedding space formalism to conformal field theories cfts on non trivial states and curved backgrounds based on the ambient metric of fefferman and graham the ambient metric is a lorentzian ricci flat metric in dimensions and replaces the minkowski metric of the embedding space it is canonically associated with a dimensional conformal manifold which is the physical spacetime where the cft lives we propose a construction of cft point functions in non trivial states and on curved backgrounds using appropriate geometric invariants of the ambient space as building blocks this captures the contributions of non vanishing point functions of multi stress energy tensors at least in holographic cfts we apply the formalism to point functions of thermal cft finding exact agreement with a holographic computation and expectations based on thermal operator product expansions opes and to cfts on squashed spheres where no prior results are known and existing methods are difficult to apply demonstrating the utility of the method\",\"in classical field theory gluing spacetime manifolds along boundary corresponds to taking a fiber product of the corresponding spaces of fields as differential graded frechet manifolds up to homotopy we construct this homotopy explicitly in several examples in the setting of bv bfv formalism batalin vilkovisky formalism with cutting gluing\",\"in this paper we establish graded t duality for models with flux after localization this establishes the most general version of t duality for type ii string theory the graded t duality map which we call bf graded hori morphism is compatible with the jacobi property of the graded fields that was earlier studied in  also included are some open problemsconjectures\",\"this paper is a follow up on the noncommutative differential geometry on infinitesimal spaces  in the present work we extend the algebraic convergence from  to the geometric setting on the one hand we reformulate the definition of finite dimensional compatible dirac operators using clifford algebras this definition also leads to a new construction of a laplace operator on the other hand after a brief introduction of the von mises fisher distribution on manifolds we show that when the dirac operators are interpreted as stochastic matrices the sequence converges in average to the usual dirac operator on a spin manifold the same conclusion can be drawn for the laplace operator\",\"we review applications of yangain symmetry to high energy qcd phenomenology some basic facts about high energy qcd are recalled in particular the spinor helicity form of scattering amplitudes the scale evolution equations of deep inelastic scattering structure functions and the high energy asymptotics of scattering as the working tool the yangian symmetric correlators are introduced and constructed in the framework of the yangian algebra of type we present the application to the tree scattering amplitudes and their iterative relation to the parton splitting amplitudes and the kernels of the scale evolution equations of structure functions and to the equations describing the high energy asymptotics of scattering\",\"we develop the theory of momentum map for the maxwell lorentz equations with spinning extended charged particle this theory is indispensable for the study of long time behaviour and radiation of the solitons of this system the development relies on the hamilton poisson structure of the system as an example we apply the theory to the rotation group of symmetry calculating the expression for the conserved angular momentum we check the coincidence of this expression with known classical invariant\",\"we analyze the non semisimple category of line operators in chern simons gauge theories based off the lie superalgebra  our proposal is that the category of line operators can be identified with the derived category of modules for a boundary vertex operator algebra realized as a certain infinite order simple current extension of the affine current algebra by boundary monopole operators by translating this simple current extension of to the unrolled restricted quantum group  we show that our category of line operators admits a second description in terms of a quantum group realized by uprolling we also compare our results across an expected physical duality with the cyclic orbifold of a free twisted hypermultiplet and find a slight discrepancy at the level of braiding we end with a detailed analysis of coupling to background flat connections and the resulting category of non genuine line operators\",\"we develop the brst bv approach to construct the general off shell lorentz covariant cubic quartic tic interaction vertices for irreducible higher spin fields on dimensional minkowski space we consider two different cases for interacting integer higher spin fields both with massless and with massive fields the deformation procedure to find minimal determined with help of generalized hilbert space brst bv action for interacting higher spin fields is based on the preservation of master equation validity in each power of coupling constant starting from the lagrangian formulation for free gauge theory as examples we consider the construction of local cubic vertices for irreducible massless fields of integer helicities and massless with one massive fields of spins  for triple of two massless scalars and tensor field of integer spin the brst bv action with cubic interaction is explicitly found unlike the previous results on cubic vertices we follow our result for brst approach arxivhep th for massless fields but for the unique brst bv action instead of classical action with reducible gauge transformations the procedure is based on the complete brst operator including the trace constraints that is used to formulate an irreducible representation with definite integer spin\",\"gauging a finite group form symmetry of a quantum field theory qft results in a qft with a rep symmetry implemented by wilson lines the group determines the fusion of wilson lines however in general the fusion rules of wilson lines do not determine  in this paper we study the properties of that can be determined from the fusion rules of wilson lines and surface operators obtained from higher gauging wilson lines this is in the spirit of richard brauer who asked what information in addition to the character table of a finite group needs to be known to determine the group we show that fusion rules of surface operators obtained from higher gauging wilson lines can be used to distinguish infinite pairs of groups which cannot be distinguished using the fusion of wilson lines we derive necessary conditions for two non isomorphic groups to have the same surface operator fusion and find a pair of such groups\",\"motivated by the recent calculation of the slkc symmetry of n point lauricella string scattering amplitudes ssa of open bosonic string theory we calculate ratios of the solvable infinite linear relations of arbitrary n point hard ssa hssa we discover a general stringy scaling behavior for all n point hssa to all string loop orders for the special case of n the stringy scaling behavior reduces to the infinite linear relations and constant ratios among hssa conjectured by gross  and later corrected and calculated by the method of decoupling of zero norm states \",\"we present a general algorithm constructing a discretization of a classical field theory from a lagrangian we prove a new discrete noether theorem relating symmetries to conservation laws and an energy conservation theorem not based on any symmetry this gives exact conservation laws for several theories eg lattice electrodynamics and gauge theory in particular we construct a conserved discrete energy momentum tensor approximating the continuum one at least for free fields the theory is stated in topological terms such as coboundary and products of cochains\",\"using m theory in physics cho gang and kim jhep    recently outlined a program that connects two parallel subjects of three dimensional manifolds namely geometric topology and quantum topology they suggest that classical topological invariants such as chern simons invariants of flat connections and adjoint reidemeister torsions of a three manifold can be packaged together to produce a topological quantum field theory which is essentially equivalent to a modular tensor category it is further conjectured that every modular tensor category can be obtained from a three manifold and a semi simple lie group in this paper we study this program mathematically and provide strong support for the feasibility of such a program the program produces an algorithm to generate the potential modular matrix and the quantum dimensions of a candidate modular data the modular matrix follows from essentially a trial and error procedure we find modular tensor categories that realize candidate modular data constructed from seifert fibered spaces and torus bundles over the circle that reveal many subtleties in the program we make a number of improvements to the program based on our computations our main result is a mathematical construction of a premodular category from each seifert fibered space with three singular fibers and a family of torus bundles over the circle with thurston sol geometry the premodular categories from seifert fibered spaces are related to temperley lieb jones categories and the ones from torus bundles over the circle are related to metaplectic categories we conjecture that a resulting premodular category is modular if and only if the three manifold is a homology sphere and condensation of bosons in premodular categories leads to either modular or super modular categories\",\"we systematically extend the elementary differential and riemannian geometry of classical gauge theory to the noncommutative setting by combining recent advances in noncommutative riemannian geometry with the theory of coherent groups we show that hermitian line bimodules with hermitian bimodule connection over a unital pre algebra with exterior algebra form a coherent group and we prove that weak monoidal functors between coherent groups canonically define bar or involutive monoidal functors in the sense of beggs majid and egger respectively hence we prove that a suitable hermitian line bimodule with hermitian bimodule connection yields an essentially unique differentiable quantum principal bundle with principal connection and vice versa here is deformed for a numerical invariant of the bimodule connection from there we formulate and solve the interrelated lifting problems for noncommutative riemannian structure in terms of abstract hodge star operators and formal spectral triples respectively all the while we account precisely for emergent modular phenomena of geometric nature in particular it follows that the spin dirac spectral triple on quantum does not lift to a twisted spectral triple on dimensional quantum with the dimensional calculus but does recover kaad kyeds compact quantum metric space on quantum for a canonical choice of parameters\",\"we study properties of vertex operator algebras associated with d h twisted supersymmetric gauge theories with a boundary the vertex operator algebras voas are defined by brst cohomologies of the currents with symplectic bosons complex fermions and bc ghosts we point out that voas for d abelian gauge theories are fermionic extensions of voas associated with toric hyper kahler varieties from this relation it follows that the voa associated with the d mirror of flavors sqed is a fermionic extension of a algebra  for  we explicitly compute the opes of elements in the brst cohomology and find a new algebra which is a fermionic extension of a bershadsky polyakov algebra  we also suggest an expression of the vacuum character of the fermionic extension of predicted by d mirror symmetry\",\"in this paper we provide a mathematically and physically consistent minimal prescription for a charged spinless point particle coupled to a constant magnetic field in a dimensional noncommutative plane it turns out to be a gauge invariant prescription in contrast to the widely and carelessly used naive minimal prescription in the context of dimensional quantum mechanics in a noncommutative plane besides we explore the noncommutative u gauge theoretic structure of the underlying noncommutative system by explicitly computing the parameter family of seiberg witten maps\",\"we solve for quantum riemannian geometries on the finite lattice interval with nodes the dynkin graph of type  and find that they are necessarily deformed with  this comes out of the intrinsic geometry and not by assuming any quantum group in the picture specifically we discover a novel boundary effect whereby in order to admit a quantum levi civita connection the metric weight at any edge is forced to be greater pointing towards the bulk compared to towards the boundary with ratio given by at node  where is a integer the christoffel symbols are also q deformed the limit likewise forces the quantum riemannian geometry of the natural numbers to have rational metric

the continuum limit of the geometry of  the laplacian for the scalar flat metric becomes the airy equation operator in so far as a limit exists scaling this metric by a conformal factor gives a limiting ricci scalar curvature proportional to \",\"we classify invertible dimensional framed and spin topological field theories by computing the homotopy groups and the invariant of the corresponding bordism categories the zeroth homotopy group of a bordism category is the usual thom bordism group the first homotopy group can be identified with a reinhart vector field bordism group or the so called skk group as observed by ebert bockstedt svane and kreck stolz teichner we present the computation of skk groups for stable tangential structures then we consider non stable examples the dimensional framed and spin skk groups and compute them explicitly using the combinatorial model of framed and spin surfaces of novak runkel and the author\",\"we investigate the underlying quantum group symmetry of d liouville and dilaton gravity models both consolidating known results and extending them to the cases with supersymmetry we first calculate the mixed parabolic representation matrix element or whittaker function of and review its applications to liouville gravity we then derive the corresponding matrix element for and apply it to explain structural features of liouville supergravity we show that this matrix element has the following properties  its limit is the classical whittaker function  it yields the plancherel measure as the density of black hole states in liouville supergravity and  it leads to symbols that match with the coupling of boundary vertex operators to the gravitational states as appropriate for liouville supergravity this object should likewise be of interest in the context of integrability of supersymmetric relativistic toda chains we furthermore relate liouville supergravity to dilaton supergravity with a hyperbolic sine prepotential we do so by showing that the quantization of the target space poisson structure in the graded poisson sigma model description leads directly to the quantum group or the quantum supergroup \",\"we study electric magnetic duality in compactifications of m theory on twisted connected sum tcs manifolds via duality with f theory specifically we study the physics of the d branes in f theory compactified on a calabi yau fourfold  dual to a compactification of m theory on a tcs manifold  supersymmetry is restored in an appropriate geometric limit in that limit we demonstrate that the dual of d branes probing seven branes corresponds to the shrinking of certain surfaces and curves yielding light particles that may carry both electric and magnetic charges we provide evidence that the minahan nemeschansky theories with flavor symmetry may be realized in this way the monodromy of the  brane system is dual to a fourier mukai transform of the dual iiam theory geometry in this limit and we extrapolate this monodromy action to the global compactification away from the limit the theory is broken to supersymmetry by a d term\",\"we present an intelligible review of recent results concerning cyclic cocycles in the spectral action and one loop quantization we show that the spectral action when perturbed by a gauge potential can be written as a series of chern simons actions and yang mills actions of all orders in the odd orders generalized chern simons forms are integrated against an odd cocycle whereas in the even orders powers of the curvature are integrated against cocycles that are hochschild cocycles as well in both cases the hochschild cochains are derived from the taylor series expansion of the spectral action tr in powers of  but unlike the taylor expansion we expand in increasing order of the forms in  we then analyze the perturbative quantization of the spectral action in noncommutative geometry and establish its one loop renormalizability as a gauge theory we show that the one loop counterterms are of the same chern simons yang mills form so that they can be safely subtracted from the spectral action a crucial role will be played by the appropriate ward identities allowing for a fully spectral formulation of the quantum theory at one loop\",\"in the presence of a nonzero b field the symmetries of the heterotic string form a group or a categorified group as do the symmetries of the chl string we express the bordism groups of the corresponding tangential structures as twisted string bordism groups then compute them through dimension modulo a few unresolved ambiguities then we use these bordism groups to study anomalies and defects for these two string theories\",\"it is known that vilkovisky dewitts effective action is gauge invariant off shell and independent of quantum field parametrization in this work we perform the calculation of the divergences in two loop vilkovisky dewitts effective action for the theory of a massive scalar field minimally coupled to gravity we quantize both gravity and scalar field around a flat minkowski metric and a constant scalar field background the quantum corrections are computed up to second order in the background scalar field for the purpose of mass renormalization\",\"we construct a non chiral conformal field theory cft on the torus that accommodates a second quantization of the elliptic calogero sutherland ecs model we show that the cft operator that provides this second quantization defines at the same time a quantum version of a soliton equation called the non chiral intermediate long wave ncilw equation we also show that this cft operator is a second quantization of a generalized ecs model which can describe arbitrary numbers of four different kinds of particles we propose that these particles can be identified with solitons of the quantum ncilw equation\",\"we construct new supersymmetric solutions of gauged supergravity where are certain four dimensional orbifolds after uplifting to massive type iia supergravity these correspond to the near horizon limit of a system of d branes and d branes wrapped on  in one class of solutions is a spindle fibred over a smooth riemann surface of genus  while in another class is a spindle fibred over another spindle both classes can be thought of as orbifold generalizations of hirzebruch surfaces and in the second case we describe the solutions in terms of toric geometry we show that the entropy associated with these solutions is reproduced by extremizing an entropy function obtained by gluing gravitational blocks using a general recipe for orbifolds that we propose we also discuss how our prescription can be used to define an off shell central charge whose extremization reproduces the gravitational central charge of analogous solutions of gauged supergravity arising from wrapping m branes on \",\"we calculate the ground state degeneracies of all twisted sectors in the conway moonshine holomorphic scft  we find that almost all sectors have ground states of only a single parity specifically twisted sectors have nontrivial ground states of a single parity twisted sectors have spontaneous supersymmetry breaking and only twisted sectors have ground states of both parities although nontrivial ground states all of the same parity is the expected behaviour for a generic sqm model without symmetry protection it is surprising in the presence of a large symmetry group as is the case in  this surprise hints that there are as yet undiscovered features of conway moonshine\",\"we deduce a non linear commutator higher spin hs symmetry algebra which encodes unitary irreducible representations of the ads group subject to a young tableaux with rows in a

differential equation for pseudoscalars in the bulk of euclidean ads arising from a truncation of dimensional supergravity over ads x szk we use math tools and in particular adomian decomposition method with initial data from near the boundary behavior of a special or general solution although we focus on normalizable modes and dirichlet boundary condition to get perturbative series solutions of the equation valid in probe approximation for three special modes of m   meantime we remind that for the skew whiffed m branes background there are higgs like pseudoscalars that make the equation homogeneous and provide spontaneous symmetry breaking then with the setups and solutions in the bulk where all supersymmetries and parity are broken we swap the three fundamental representations of so for gravitino deform the abjm like three dimensional boundary actions with various corresponding su x u singlet operators made of fermions scalars and sun gauge fields find new so invariant instantons and finally adjust the bulk and boundary solutions and confirm state operator adscft correspondence\",\"in this article we present the definitive transformation formulae of the mass aspect and angular momentum aspect under bms transformations two different approaches that lead to the same formulae are taken in the first approach the formulae are derived by reading off the aspect functions from the curvature tensor while in the second and more traditional approach we read them off from the metric coefficients as an application of the angular momentum aspect transformation formula we directly verify a relation concerning the dray streubel angular momentum it also enables us to reinterpret our calculations in terms of differential forms on null infinity and leads to an exact expression of the drey streubel angular momentum of a general section the formulae we obtained played crucial roles in our recent work on supertranslation invariant charges and resolved some inconsistencies in the literature\",\"non commutative geometry ncg is a mathematical discipline developed in the s by alain connes it is presented as a new generalization of usual geometry both encompassing and going beyond the riemannian framework within a purely algebraic formalism like riemannian geometry ncg also has links with physics indeed ncg provided a powerful framework for the reformulation of the standard model of particle physics smpp taking into account general relativity in a single geometric representation based on non commutative gauge theories ncgft moreover this accomplishment provides a convenient framework to study various possibilities to go beyond the smpp such as grand unified theories guts this thesis intends to show an elegant method recently developed by thierry masson and myself which proposes a general scheme to elaborate guts in the framework of ncgfts this concerns the study of ncgfts based on approximately finite algebras af algebras using either derivations of the algebra or spectral triples to build up the underlying differential structure of the gauge theory the inductive sequence defining the af algebra is used to allow the construction of a sequence of ncgfts of yang mills higgs types so that the rank can represent a grand unified theory of the rank  the main advantage of this framework is that it controls using appropriate conditions the interaction of the degrees of freedom along the inductive sequence on the af algebra this suggests a way to obtain gut like models while offering many directions of theoretical investigation to go beyond the smpp\",\"closed strings can be seen either as one dimensional objects in a target space or as points in the free loop space correspondingly a b field can be seen either as a connection on a gerbe over the target space or as a connection on a line bundle over the loop space transgression establishes an equivalence between these two perspectives open strings require d branes submanifolds equipped with vector bundles twisted by the gerbe in this paper we develop a loop space perspective on d branes it involves bundles of simple frobenius algebras over the branes together with bundles of bimodules over spaces of paths connecting two branes we prove that the classical and our new perspectives on d branes are equivalent further we compare our loop space perspective to moore segallauda pfeiffer data for open closed dimensional topological quantum field theories and exhibit it as a smooth family of reflection positive colored knowledgable frobenius algebras\",\"in space time dimensions we introduce a gravity theory whose massless spectrum can be acted upon by the monster group when reduced to dimensions this theory generalizes m theory in many respects and we name it monstrous m theory or m theory upon kaluza klein reduction to dimensions the m theory spectrum irreducibly splits as  where is identified with the dilaton and is the dimension of the smallest non trivial representation of the monster this provides a field theory explanation of the lowest instance of the monstrous moonshine and it clarifies the definition of the monster as the automorphism group of the griess algebra by showing that such an algebra is not merely a sum of unrelated spaces but descends from massless states for m theory which includes horowitz and susskinds bosonic m theory as a subsector further evidence is provided by the decomposition of the coefficients of the partition function of wittens extremal monster scft in terms of representations of  the massless little group in  the purely bosonic nature of the involved representations may be traced back to the unique feature of dimensions which allow for a non trivial generalization of the triality holding in dimensions last but not least a certain subsector of m theory when coupled to a rarita schwinger massless field in  exhibits the same number of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom we cannot help but conjecture the existence of a would be supergravity theory in space time dimensions\",\"the yang model is an example of noncommutative geometry on a background spacetime of constant curvature we discuss the hermitian realizations of its associated algebra on phase space in a perturbative expansion up to sixth order we also discuss its realizations on extended phase spaces that include additional tensorial andor vectorial degrees or freedom\",null],\"marker\":{\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"0_theories_gauge_theory\",\"text\":[\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"0_theories_gauge_theory\"],\"textfont\":{\"size\":12},\"x\":[5.645442008972168,5.106507778167725,5.3782548904418945,5.777033805847168,5.889163970947266,6.158349514007568,6.521873474121094,6.131762981414795,4.822997093200684,6.137473106384277,5.219898223876953,4.809365749359131,6.207024097442627,5.69805908203125,5.828551769256592,5.057302474975586,5.357902526855469,5.610937595367432,5.591911315917969,5.901787281036377,6.45693826675415,5.741949081420898,5.426251411437988,5.258918285369873,6.299622058868408,6.094130516052246,5.6203155517578125,6.148191928863525,5.666928291320801,6.030462741851807,5.588253974914551,5.910645008087158,7.4517598152160645,4.978847026824951,5.1197075843811035,5.3112688064575195,5.313573360443115,5.888408184051514,4.848285675048828,6.01450252532959,6.099379062652588,5.330986022949219,5.057429790496826,5.3361124992370605,6.127237319946289,5.285840034484863,5.2812676429748535,5.556951522827148,6.21807336807251,6.155546188354492,5.756506443023682,6.4346394538879395,5.202812194824219,5.9129958152771,5.90200138092041,2.939624309539795,6.238574504852295,6.461502552032471,6.147879123687744,5.129825115203857,5.35524845123291,5.5239362716674805,5.516008377075195,6.134341716766357,5.246868133544922,5.306654930114746,5.70699405670166,6.020373344421387,6.092239856719971,6.569578170776367,6.2414069175720215,5.091777324676514,6.090908527374268,5.0558013916015625,5.703326225280762,6.113694667816162,5.310756206512451,6.31558895111084,6.461536407470703,5.018477439880371,4.7965826988220215,6.238297462463379,5.923152923583984,5.829163551330566,6.220860004425049,5.668203830718994,5.2142767906188965,6.206967830657959,6.5349602699279785,5.524751663208008,6.1305437088012695,6.245373725891113,6.443960666656494,5.97150993347168,5.468389987945557,5.397838115692139,5.682989120483398,5.202545642852783,6.422738552093506,6.163609981536865,5.6431450843811035,5.356542587280273,5.439241886138916,5.266137599945068,6.2744951248168945,5.866009712219238,5.7564473152160645,6.114695072174072,4.97251558303833,6.274616241455078,5.521057605743408,6.690162181854248,4.8709306716918945,5.535226821899414,4.795797824859619,5.520485877990723,5.931301116943359,5.410557746887207,5.495819091796875,5.422584533691406,6.430346965789795,5.543225288391113,5.331056594848633,6.151875972747803,6.053564071655273,6.133553504943848,6.376195430755615,5.120546340942383,5.924297332763672,5.298415184020996,5.29400634765625,6.029409408569336,5.887845993041992,4.896002769470215,5.982205867767334,5.653555393218994,4.760439872741699,4.908287525177002,5.261462688446045,5.869446754455566,5.778631210327148,5.603492736816406,5.89408016204834,4.987090110778809,4.818675518035889,4.747212886810303,6.210508823394775,5.133193016052246,6.24021577835083,5.928234100341797,5.021512985229492,6.588615894317627,5.643398761749268,6.3754143714904785,5.459454536437988,5.312858581542969,6.443436145782471,5.491672039031982,5.916796684265137,5.728425979614258,6.043560981750488,5.209596633911133,6.126266002655029,5.870939254760742,6.113010883331299,5.138886451721191,5.865990161895752,4.9252095222473145,6.404871940612793,5.931812763214111,5.767595291137695,5.534701347351074,5.698121070861816],\"y\":[10.10430908203125,9.777087211608887,9.630232810974121,10.281745910644531,10.615011215209961,10.277149200439453,10.360404014587402,10.541055679321289,9.711467742919922,10.198932647705078,9.380894660949707,9.473495483398438,10.266830444335938,10.069864273071289,10.231139183044434,9.708651542663574,9.447744369506836,9.358555793762207,9.85446834564209,10.534597396850586,10.513957023620605,9.331583976745605,9.564305305480957,9.743658065795898,10.51793098449707,10.247379302978516,9.87113094329834,10.145264625549316,10.075275421142578,10.457819938659668,9.886741638183594,10.645877838134766,8.876914978027344,9.191285133361816,9.750378608703613,9.38129997253418,9.774484634399414,10.643200874328613,9.699841499328613,10.451988220214844,10.15201187133789,9.421024322509766,9.942625045776367,9.458459854125977,10.4388628005

d euler equations assuming that is an annular domain we prove that the streamlines of the flow are circular we are also able to remove the topological condition on if we impose regularity and nondegeneracy assumptions on at  the proof uses that the corresponding stream function solves an elliptic semilinear problem with at the boundary one of the main difficulties in our study is that is not lipschitz continuous near the boundary values however vanishes at the boundary values and then we can apply a local symmetry result of f brock to conclude in the case at this argument is not possible in this case we are able to use the moving plane scheme to show symmetry despite the possible lack of regularity of  we think that such result is interesting in its own right and will be stated and proved also for higher dimensions the proof requires the study of maximum principles hopf lemma and serrin corner lemma for elliptic linear operators with singular coefficients\",\"viscous streaming is an efficient rectification mechanism to exploit flow inertia at small scales for fluid and particle manipulation it typically entails a fluid vibrating around an immersed solid feature that by concentrating stresses modulates the emergence of steady flows of useful topology motivated by its relevance in biological and artificial settings characterized by soft materials recent studies have theoretically elucidated in two dimensions the impact of body elasticity on streaming flows here we generalize those findings to three dimensions via the minimal case of an immersed soft sphere we first improve existing solutions for the rigid sphere limit by considering previously unaccounted terms we then enable body compliance exposing a three dimensional elastic streaming process available even in stokes flows such effect consistent with two dimensional analyses but analytically distinct is validated against direct numerical simulations and shown to translate to bodies of complex geometry and topology paving the way for advanced forms of flow control\",\"a diffused interface model describing the evolution of two conterminous incompressible fluids in a porous medium is discussed the system consists of the cahn hilliard equation with flory huggins logarithmic potential coupled via surface tension term with the evolutionary stokes equation at the pore scale an evolving diffused interface of finite thickness depending on the scale parameter separates the fluids the model is studied in a bounded domain with a sufficiently smooth boundary in for   at first we investigate the existence of the system at the micro scale and derive the essential textita priori estimates then using the two scale convergence approach and unfolding operator technique we obtain the homogenized model for the microscopic one\",\"this paper concerns the existence of global weak solutions it a la leray for compressible navier stokes fourier systems with periodic boundary conditions and the truncated virial pressure law which is assumed to be thermodynamically unstable more precisely the main novelty is that the pressure law is not assumed to be monotone with respect to the density this provides the first global weak solutions result for the compressible navier stokes fourier system with such kind of pressure law which is strongly used as a generalization of the perfect gas law the paper is based on a new construction of approximate solutions through an iterative scheme and fixed point procedure which could be very helpful to design efficient numerical schemes note that our method involves the recent paper by the authors published in nonlinearity  for the compactness of the density when the temperature is given\",\"we obtain estimates of all components of the velocity of a d rigid body moving in a viscous incompressible fluid without any symmetry restriction on the shape of the rigid body or the container the estimates are in terms of suitable norms of the velocity field in a small domain of the fluid only provided the distance between the rigid body and the container is small as a consequence we obtain suitable differential inequalities that control the distance  the results are obtained using the fact that the vector field under investigation belongs to suitable function spaces without any use of hydrodynamic equations\",\"we are interested in the stability analysis of two dimensional incompressible inviscid fluids specifically we revisit a recent result on the stability of yudovichs solutions to the incompressible euler equations in by providing a new approach to its proof based on the idea of compactness extrapolation and by extending it to the whole plane this new method of proof is robust and when applied to viscous models leads to a remarkable logarithmic improvement on the rate of convergence in the vanishing viscosity limit of two dimensional fluids loosely speaking this logarithmic gain is the result of the fact that in appropriate high regularity settings the smoothness of solutions to the euler equations at times is strictly higher than their regularity at time  this memory effect seems to be a general principle which is not exclusive to fluid mechanics it is therefore likely to be observed in other setting and deserves further investigation finally we also apply the stability results on euler systems to the study of two dimensional ideal plasmas and establish their convergence in strong topologies to solutions of magnetohydrodynamic systems when the speed of light tends to infinity the crux of this asymptotic analysis relies on a fine understanding of maxwells system\",\"hyperbolic curvature flow is a geometric evolution equation that in the plane can be viewed as the natural hyperbolic analogue of curve shortening flow it was proposed by gurtin and podio guidugli  to model certain wave phenomena in solid liquid interfaces we introduce a semidiscrete finite difference method for the approximation of hyperbolic curvature flow and prove error bounds for natural discrete norms we also present numerical simulations including the onset of singularities

paper and by joseph  joseph and carmi and busse  all these authors obtained their results applying variational methods to compute the maximum of a functional ratio derived from the reynolds orr energy identity orr and joseph obtained different results for instance in the couette case orr computed the critical reynolds value of  on spanwise perturbations and joseph  on streamwise perturbations recently in falsaperla et al  the authors conjectured that the search of the maximum should be restricted to a subspace of the space of kinematically admissible perturbations with this conjecture the critical nonlinear energy reynolds number was found among spanwise perturbations a squire theorem for nonlinear systems with a direct proof and an appropriate and original decomposition of the dissipation terms in the reynolds orr identity we show the validity of this conjecture in the space of three dimensional perturbations\",\"rossby haurwitz rh waves are important explicit solutions of the incompressible euler equation on a two dimensional rotating sphere in this paper we prove the orbital stability of degree rh waves in norm of the absolute vorticity for any  which verifies a conjecture of a constantin and p germain in arch ration mech anal   the proofs are achieved by establishing new variational principles for degree rh waves in conjunction with conservation laws and

prove that the least stabilizing perturbations in the energy norm are the two dimensional spanwise perturbations and give some criti cal reynolds numbers re for some selected prandtl and hartmann numbers this result solves a conjecture given in a recent paper by falsaperla et al and implies a squire theorem for nonlinear energy the less stabilizing perturbations in the textitenergy norm are the two dimensional spanwise perturbations moreover for reynolds numbers less than re there can be no transient energy growth\",\"this paper focuses on the novel scheme to unify both lagrangian staggered grid and cell centered hydrodynamic methods in one dimension the scheme neither contains empirical parameters nor solves the riemann problem it includes two key points one is the relationship between pressure and velocity and the other is newtons second law the two methods that make use of this scheme satisfy the entropy condition and are conservative in total mass momentum and energy numerical results show the robustness and accuracy of both methods\",\"in this paper we investigate the dynamics of solutions of the muskat equation with initial interface consisting of multiple corners allowing for linear growth at infinity specifically we prove that if the initial data contains a finite set of small corners then we can find a precise description of the solution showing how these corners desingularize and move at the same time at the analytical level we are solving a small data critical problem which requires renormalization this is accomplished using a nonlinear change of variables which serves as a logarithmic correction and accurately describes the motion of the corners during the evolution\",\"inspired by the numerical evidence of a potential d euler singularity  we prove finite time blowup of the d boussinesq and d axisymmetric euler equations with smooth initial data of finite energy and boundary there are several essential difficulties in proving finite time blowup of the d euler equations with smooth initial data one of the essential difficulties is to control a number of nonlocal terms that do not seem to offer any damping effect another essential difficulty is that the strong advection normal to the boundary introduces a large growth factor for the perturbation if we use weighted or estimates we overcome this difficulty by using a combination of a weighted norm and a weighted norm and develop sharp functional inequalities using the symmetry properties of the kernels and some techniques from optimal transport moreover we decompose the linearized operator into a leading order operator plus a finite rank operator the leading order operator is designed in such a way that we can obtain sharp stability estimates the contribution from the finite rank operator to linear stability can be estimated by constructing approximate solutions in space time this enables us to establish nonlinear stability of the approximate self similar profile and prove stable nearly self similar blowup of the d boussinesq and d euler equations with smooth initial data and boundary\",\"how does one derive models of dynamical feedback effects in multiscale multiphysics systems such as wave mean flow interaction wmfi we shall address this question for hybrid dynamical systems whose motion can be expressed as the composition of two or more lie group actions hybrid systems abound in fluid dynamics examples include the dynamics of complex fluids such as liquid crystals wind driven waves propagating with the currents moving on the sea surface turbulence modelling in fluids and plasmas and classical quantum hydrodynamic models in molecular chemistry from among these examples the motivating question in this paper is how do wind driven waves produce ocean surface currents the paper first summarises the geometric mechanics approach for deriving hybrid models of multiscale multiphysics motions in ideal fluid dynamics it then illustrates this approach for wmfi in the examples of d wkb waves and d wave amplitudes governed by the nonlinear schrodinger nls equation propagating in the frame of motion of an ideal incompressible inhomogeneous euler fluid flow the results for these examples tell us that the fluid flow in wmfi does not create waves however feedback in the opposite direction is possible since d wkb and d nls

speed coating processes this work provides an analytical solution to the boundary layer problem for ostwald de waele power law fluids via a power series expansion and extends the approach taken for newtonian fluids naghshineh et al on the use of asymptotically motivated gauge functions to obtain convergent series solutions to nonlinear odes ima j of appl math  in which variable substitutions which naturally determine the gauge function in the power series are chosen to be consistent with the large distance behavior away from the wall contrary to prior literature the asymptotic behavior dictates that a solution only exists in the range of power law exponents  lying in the range  an analytical solution is obtained in the range of approximately  using a convergent power series with an asymptotically motivated gauge function for power laws corresponding to  the gauge function becomes ill defined over the full domain and an approximate analytical solution is obtained using the method of asymptotic approximants barlow et al on the summation of divergent truncated and underspecified power series via asymptotic approximants q j mech appl math  the approximant requires knowledge of two physical constants which we compute a priori using a numerical shooting method on a finite domain the utility of the power series solution is that it can be solved on the entire semi infinite domain and in contrast to a numerical solution does not require a finite domain length approximation and subsequent domain length refinement\",\"in this work we consider the two and three dimensional convective brinkman forchheimer cbf equations or damped navier stokes equations on a torus  where and is the absorption exponent for and  for  we first show the backward uniqueness of deterministic cbf equations by exploiting the logarithmic convexity property and the global solvability results available in the literature as a direct consequence of the backward uniqueness result we first derive the approximate controllability with respect to the initial data viewed as a start controller secondly we apply the backward uniqueness results in the attractor theory to show the zero lipschitz deviation of the global attractors for d and d cbf equations by an application of log lipschitz regularity we prove the uniqueness of lagrangian trajectories in d and d cbf flows and the continuity of lagrangian trajectories with respect to the eulerian initial data finally we consider the stochastic cbf equations with a linear multiplicative gaussian noise for and  for  we show the pathwise backward uniqueness as well as approximate controllability via starter controller results in particular the results obtained in this work hold true for d navier stokes equations\",\"we identify a sufficient condition under which solutions to the d forced navier stokes equations satisfy an in time version of the kolmogorov  law for the behavior of the averaged third order longitudinal structure function along the vanishing viscosity limit the result has a natural probabilistic interpretation the predicted behavior is observed on average after waiting for some sufficiently generic random time the sufficient condition is satisfied eg by the solutions constructed by brue colombo crippa delellis and sorella in this particular case our results can be applied to derive a bound for the exponent of the third order absolute structure function in accordance with the kolmogorov turbulence theory\",\"this is the second paper in a series studying the nonlinear stability of rarefaction waves in multi dimensional gas dynamics we construct initial data near singularities in the rarefaction wave region and combined with the a priori energy estimates from the first paper demonstrate that any smooth perturbation of constant states on one side of the diaphragm in a shock tube can be connected to a centered rarefaction wave we apply this analysis to study multi dimensional perturbations of

generalizes the result of to functions which are heavy tailed in fourier space or have local finite time singularities in the inviscid limit in other words we have rigorously derived the well known physical relationship the direct cascade is a local process and is non trivial if and only if energy moves toward the small scales or singularities have occurred similarly an inverse cascade occurs if and only if energy moves towards the fourier mode in the invisicid limit\",\"having a finite interfacial thickness the phase field models supply a way to model the fluid interfaces which allows the calculations of the interface movements and deformations on the fixed grids such modeling is applied to the computation of two phase incompressible stokes flows in this paper leading to a system of stokes cahn hilliard equations the stokes equation is modified by adding the continuum force  where is the order parameter and is the chemical potential of  similarly the advection effects are modeled by addition of the term in the cahn hilliard equation we hereby discuss how the solutions to the above equations approach the original sharp interface stokes equation as the interfacial thickness tends to zero we start with a microscopic model and then the homogenized or upscaled version to the same from authors previous work cf  where the analysis and homogenization of the system have been performed in detail further we perform the numerical computations to compare the outcome of the effective model with the original heterogeneous microscale model\",\"in an inviscid and incompressible fluid in dimension  we prove the existence of several helical filaments or vortex helices collapsing into each others\",\"in this paper we investigate nonlinear stability of planar steady euler flows related to least energy solutions of the lane emden equation in a smooth bounded domain we prove the orbital stability of these flows in terms of both the norm of the vorticity for any and the energy norm as a consequence nonlinear stability is obtained when the least energy solution is unique which actually holds for a large class of domains and exponents the proofs are based on a new variational characterization of least energy solutions in terms of the vorticity a compactness argument and proper use of conserved quantities of the euler equation\",\"in this paper we prove the existence of

boussinesq equations of inviscid incompressible flows with both fast rossby waves and fast internal gravity waves the main objective is to establish a rigorous derivation and justification of a new generalized quasi geostrophic approximation in a channel domain with no normal flow at the upper and lower solid boundaries taking into account the resonance terms due to the fast and slow waves interactions under these circumstances we are able to obtain uniform estimates and compactness without the requirement of either well prepared initial data as in  or domain with no boundary as in  in particular the nonlinear resonances and the new limit system which takes into account the fast waves correction to the slow waves dynamics are also identified without introducing fourier series expansion the key ingredient includes the introduction of full generalized potential vorticity\",\"we prove the nonlinear inviscid damping for a class of monotone shear flows with non constant background density for the two dimensional ideal inhomogeneous fluids in when the initial perturbation is in gevrey  class with compact support\",\"in this paper we consider the cauchy problem of the multi dimensional compressible navier stokes euler system for two phase flow motion which consists of the isentropic compressible navier stokes equations and the isothermal compressible euler equations coupled with each other through a relaxation drag force we first establish the local existence and uniqueness of the strong solution for general initial data in a critical homogeneous besov space and then prove the global existence of the solution if the initial data is a small perturbation of the equilibrium state moreover under the additional condition that the low frequency part of the initial perturbation also belongs to another besov space with lower regularity we obtain the optimal time decay rates of the global solution toward the equilibrium state these results imply that the relaxation drag force and the viscosity dissipation affect regularity properties and long time behaviors of solutions for the compressible navier stokes euler system\",\"in this paper we consider the shock formation problem for the dimensionald compressible euler equations with damping inspired by the work  it will be shown that for a class of large data the damping can not prevent the formation of point shock and the damping effect shifts the shock time and the wave amplitude while the shock location and the blow up direction remain the same with the information of this point shock being computed explicitly moreover the vorticity is concentrated in the non blow up direction which varies exponentially due to the damping effect our proof is based on the estimates for the modulated self similar variables and lower bounds for the lagrangian trajectories\",\"to understand the formations of singularities of the euler poisson system with vacuum we revisit makinos star model in this article we first remedy to some extent the inconveniences of makinos star model and remove its imposed nonphysically exterior free falling velocity field by only specifying the velocity field on a compact support of the density makino has coined the presence of such an exterior velocity field as a cheshire cat phenomenon and he  and rendall  have both emphasized the difficulty of removing this phenomenon moreover we obtain an improved local existence and uniqueness theorem for initial data for the density and velocity that both have compact support finally we are able to prove a localized strong continuation criterion in which the breakdown of solutions is only controlled by quantities defined on the compact support of the solution in addition the localized strong continuation criterion also generalizes the continuation criterion from the incompressible euler equation in a bounded domain  to the compressible euler poisson system\",\"we consider mild solutions to the navier

maximal existence time  is independent of  if is finite then we have the blow up estimate with explicit dependence on  for all  the solution is unique among all solutions in the larger class  and if then  we also establish additional properties of the solution depending on the besov spaces to which the initial data belongs\",\"this paper considers the asymptotic limit of small aspect ratio between vertical and horizontal spatial scales for viscous isothermal compressible flows in particular it is observed that fast vertical acoustic waves arise and induce an averaging mechanism of the density in the vertical variable which at the limit leads to the hydrostatic approximation of compressible flows ie the compressible primitive equations of atmospheric dynamics we justify the hydrostatic approximation for general as well as well prepared initial data the initial data is called well prepared when it is close to the hydrostatic balance in a strong topology moreover the convergence rate is calculated in the well prepared initial data case in terms of the aspect ratio as the latter goes to zero\",\"townsends attached eddy hypothesis decomposes the logarithmic layer of high reynolds number turbulent boundary layers as a field of randomly distributed self similar eddies that are assumed to be attached to the wall and obey a scaling relationship with the wall distance the attached eddy model has emerged as an elegant and successful theory to explain the physics structure and statistics of the logarithmic layer in wall turbulence building on the statistical framework of woodcock and marusic  the present work details quantitative results on the structure of the attached eddies and their impact on velocity moment predictions an inverse problem is posed to infer the ideal eddy contribution function that yields precise first and second order velocity moments obtained from direct numerical simulations this ideal function is further simplified and is used to guide the proposal of a hairpin type prototypical eddy which is shown to yield reasonable predictions of the velocity moments this hairpin type structure is improved upon by a solving a constrained optimization problem to infer an idealized eddy shape and b inferring the circulation distribution of a hairpin packet the associated forward and inverse modeling procedure is general enough to serve as a foundation to model the flow beyond the log layer and the codes are open sourced to the community to aid further research\",\"in this article we consider a damped version of the incompressible navier stokes equations in the whole three dimensional space with a divergence free and time independent external force within the framework of a well prepared force and with a particular choice of the damping parameter when the grashof numbers are large enough we are able to prove some estimates from below and from above between the fluid characteristic velocity and the energy dissipation rate according to the kolmogorov dissipation law precisely our main contribution concerns the estimate from below which is not often studied in the existing literature moreover we address some remarks which open the door to a deep discussion on the validity of this theory of turbulence\",\"we consider here an elliptic coupled system describing the dynamics of liquid crystals flows this system is posed on the whole n dimensional space we introduce first the notion of very weak solutions for this system then within the fairly general framework of the morrey spaces we derive some sufficient

incompressible liquid due to thermal effects the asymptotic model a prosperetti j fluid mech  and z biro and j j l velazquez siam j math anal  is one where the pressure within the gas bubble is spatially uniform and satisfies an ideal gas law relating the pressure density and temperature of the gas the temperature of the surrounding liquid is taken to be constant and the behavior of the liquid pressure at infinity is prescribed to be constant or periodic in time in arxiv for the case where the liquid pressure at infinity is a positive constant we proved the existence of a one parameter manifold of spherical equilibria parameterized by the bubble mass and further proved that it is a nonlinearly and exponentially asymptotically stable center manifold in the present article we first refine the exponential time decay estimates via a study of the linearized dynamics subject to the constraint of fixed mass we obtain in particular estimates for the exponential decay rate constant which highlight the interplay between the effects of thermal diffusivity and the liquid viscosity we then study the nonlinear radial dynamics of the bubble fluid system subject to a pressure field at infinity which is a small amplitude and time periodic perturbation about a positive constant we prove that nonlinearly and exponentially asymptotically stable time periodically pulsating solutions of the nonlinear asymptotic model exist for all sufficiently small forcing amplitudes the existence of such states is formulated as a fixed point problem for the poincare return map and the existence of a fixed point makes use of our constant mass constrained exponential time decay estimates of the linearized problem\",\"in this paper we consider d navier stokes equations with almost axisymmetric initial data which means that by writing in the cylindrical coordinates then and are small in some sense recall axisymmetric means these three quantities vanish then with additional smallness assumption on  we prove the global existence of a unique strong solution  and this solution keeps close to some axisymmetric vector field we also establish some refined estimates for the integral average in variable for  moreover as and here depend on  it is natural to expand them into fourier series in variable and we shall consider one special form of  with some small parameter to measure its swirl part and oscillating part we study the asymptotic expansion of the corresponding solution and the influences between different profiles in the asymptotic expansion in particular we give some special symmetric structures that will persist for all time these phenomena reflect some features of the nonlinear terms in navier stokes equations\",\"a recent prominent result asserts that steady incompressible euler flows strictly away from stagnation in a two dimensional infinitely long strip must be shear flows on the other hand flows with stagnation points very challenging in analysis are interesting and important phenomenon in fluids in this paper we study flows with stagnation points such as poiseuille flows and establish the uniqueness and existence of steady solutions for the euler system in an infinitely long nozzle first we prove a liouville type theorem for steady euler system with poiseuille flows as upstream far field state in an infinitely long strip due to the appearance of stagnation points the nonlinearity of the semilinear equation for the stream function becomes non lipschitz this creates a challenging analysis problem since many classical analysis methods do not apply directly second the uniqueness of flows with positive horizontal velocity inside the general nozzles is established finally a class of steady incompressible euler flows tending to poiseuille flows in the upstream are proved to exist in an infinitely long nozzle via variational approach a very interesting phenomenon we observe is that the free boundary may appear for flows with stagnation point\",\"we study the stationary navier stokes equations in the region between two rotating concentric cylinders we first prove that under the small reynolds number if the fluid is axisymmetric and if its velocity is sufficiently small in the norm then it is necessarily a generalized taylor couette flow if in addition the associated pressure is bounded or periodic in the axis then it coincides with the well known canonical taylor couette flow next we give a certain bound of the reynolds number and the norm of the velocity such as the fluid is indeed necessarily axisymmetric it is clarified that smallness of reynolds number of the fluid in the two rotating concentric cylinders governs both axisymmetry and the exact form of the taylor couette flow\",\"we show

the centuries mathematicians have been challenged by the partial differential equations pdes that describe the motion of fluids in many physical contexts important and beautiful results were obtained in the past one hundred years including the groundbreaking work of ladyzhenskaya on the navier stokes equations however crucial questions such as the existence uniqueness and regularity of the three dimensional navier stokes equations remain open partly because of this mathematical challenge and partly motivated by the phenomena of turbulence insights into the full pdes have been sought via the study of simpler approximating systems that retain some of the original nonlinear features one such simpler system is an infinite dimensional coupled set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations

dissipative measure valued martingale solutions for stochastic compressible navier stokes equations these solutions are weak from a probabilistic perspective since they include both the driving wiener process and the probability space as an integral part of the solution then for the stochastic compressible navier stokes system we establish the relative energy inequality and as a result we demonstrate the path wise weak strong uniqueness principle we also look at the inviscid incompressible limit of the underlying system of equations using the relative energy inequality\",\"we introduce an adaptive viscosity regularization approach for the numerical solution of systems of nonlinear conservation laws with shock waves the approach seeks to solve a sequence of regularized problems consisting of the system of conservation laws and an additional helmholtz equation for the artificial viscosity we propose a homotopy continuation of the regularization parameters to minimize the amount of artificial viscosity subject to positivity preserving and smoothness constraints on the numerical solution the regularization methodology is combined with a mesh adaptation strategy that identifies the shock location and generates shock aligned meshes which allows to further reduce the amount of artificial dissipation and capture shocks with increased accuracy we use the hybridizable discontinuous galerkin method to numerically solve the regularized system of conservation laws and the continuous galerkin method to solve the helmholtz equation for the artificial viscosity we show that the approach can produce approximate solutions that converge to the exact solution of the burgers equation finally we demonstrate the performance of the method on inviscid transonic supersonic hypersonic flows in two dimensions the approach is found to be accurate robust and efficient and yields very sharp yet smooth solutions in a few homotopy iterations\",\"we consider the sharp interface limit of a navier stokesallen cahn equation in a bounded smooth domain in two space dimensions in the case of vanishing mobility  where the small parameter related to the thickness of the diffuse interface is sent to zero for well prepared initial data and sufficiently small times we rigorously prove convergence to the classical two phase navier stokes system with surface tension the idea of the proof is to use asymptotic expansions to construct an approximate solution and to estimate the difference of the exact and approximate solutions with a spectral estimate for the at the approximate solution linearized allen cahn operator in the calculations we use a fractional order ansatz and new ansatz terms in higher orders leading to a suitable scaled and coupled model problem moreover we apply the novel idea of introducing dependent coordinates\",\"we prove that stable fluid equilibria with trivial homology on curved reflection symmetric periodic channels must posses islands or cats eye vortices in this way arbitrarily small disturbances of a flat boundary cause a change of streamline topology of stable steady states\",\"we propose a two point flux approximation finite volume scheme for the approximation of two cross diffusion systems coupled by a free interface to account for vapor deposition the moving interface is addressed with a cut cell approach where the mesh is locally deformed around the interface the scheme preserves the structure of the continuous system namely mass conservation nonnegativity volume filling constraints and decay of the free energy numerical results illustrate the properties of the scheme\",\"we show the existence of a velocity field  solution of randomly forced navier stokes equations which produces total dissipation of kinetic energy in finite time when advecting a passive scalar  the total dissipation holds true uniformly in the viscosity parameter and the initial conditions  in particular the dissipation is anomalous

lattice of topological resonators we examine the energy conserving or energy dissipating property in relation to the choices of simple mesh independent numerical fluxes we demonstrate that with certain numerical flux choices our dg method achieves optimal convergence in the norm we provide numerical experiments that validate and illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed numerical methods\",\"we treat the d shock tube problem establishing existence of steady solutions of full nonisentropic polytropic gas dynamics with arbitrary noncharacteristic data we present also numerical experiments indicating uniqueness and time asymptotic stability of such solutions at the same time we give an example of an artificial equation of state possessing a convex entropy for which there holds nonuniqueness of solutions this is associated with instability and hopf bifurcation to time periodic solutions in a second part we study general systems of viscous conservation laws and we state results on existence stability and spectral stability of steady states in restricted cases\",\"we study the enstrophy cascade at small spatial scales in statistically stationary forced dissipated d navier stokes equations subjected to the coriolis force in the beta plane approximation we provide sufficient conditions inspired by  to prove that on small scales in the presence of the coriolis force the so called third order structure functions asymptotics follows the third order universal law of d turbulence without the coriolis force our result indicates that on small scales the enstrophy flux from larger to smaller scales is not affected by the coriolis force confirming experimental and numerical observations to the best of our knowledge this is the first mathematically rigorous study of the above equations we also proved well posedness and certain regularity properties to obtain the mentioned results\",\"we are concerned with nonlinear stability and existence of two dimensional current vortex sheets in ideal compressible magnetohydrodynamics this is a nonlinear hyperbolic initial boundary value problem with characteristic free boundary it is well known that current vortex sheets may be at most weakly neutrally stable due to the existence of surface waves solutions that yield a loss of derivatives in the energy estimate of the solution with respect to the source terms we first identify a sufficient condition ensuring the weak stability of the linearized current vortex sheets problem under this stability condition for the background state we show that the linearized problem obeys an energy estimate in anisotropic weighted sobolev spaces with a loss of derivatives based on the weakly linear stability results we then establish the local in time existence and nonlinear stability of current vortex sheets by a suitable nash moser iteration provided the stability condition is satisfied at each point of the initial discontinuity this result gives a new confirmation of the stabilizing effect of sufficiently strong magnetic fields on kelvin helmholtz instabilities\",\"in this paper a model of the development of a quantum turbulence in its initial stage is proposed the origin of the turbulence in the suggested model is the decay of vortex loops with an internal structure we consider the initial stage of this process before an equilibrium state

the author earlier\",\"we study a d fluid rigid body interaction problem the fluid flow is governed by d incompressible navier stokes equations while the motion of the rigid body is described by a system of ordinary differential equations describing conservation of linear and angular momentum our aim is to prove that any weak solution satisfying certain regularity conditions is smooth this is a generalization of the classical result for the incompressible navier stokes equations which says that a weak solution that additionally satisfy prodi serrin condition is smooth we show that in the case of fluid rigid body the prodi serrin conditions imply and regularity for the fluid velocity and fluid pressure respectively moreover we show that solutions are if additionally we assume that the rigid body acceleration is bounded almost anywhere in time variable\",\"in this paper we investigate the wave solutions of a stochastic rotating shallow water model this approximate model provides an interesting simple description of the interplay between waves and random forcing ensuing either from the wind or coming as the feedback of the ocean on the atmosphere and leading in a very fast way to the selection of some wavelength this interwoven yet simple mechanism explains the emergence of typical wavelength associated to near inertial waves ensemble mean waves that are not in phase with the random forcing are damped at an exponential rate whose magnitude depends on the random forcing variance geostrophic adjustment is also interpreted as a statistical homogenization process in which in order to conserve potential vorticity the small scale component tends to align to the velocity fields to form a statistically homogeneous random field\",\"the one dimensional compressible navier stokes vlasov fokker planck system with density dependent viscosity and drag force coefficients is investigated in the present paper the existence uniqueness and regularity of global weak solution to the initial value problem for general initial data are established in spatial periodic domain moreover the long time behavior of the weak solution is analyzed it is shown that as the time grows the distribution function of the particles converges to the global maxwellian and both the fluid velocity and the macroscopic velocity of the particles converge to the same speed\",\"this article revisits the instability of sharp shear interfaces also called vortex sheets in incompressible fluid flows we study the birkhoff rott equation which describes the motion of vortex sheets according to the incompressible euler equations in two dimensions the classical kelvin helmholtz instability demonstrates that an infinite flat vortex sheet has a strong linear instability we show that this is not the case for circular vortex sheets such a configuration has a delicate linear stability and is the first example of a linearly stable solution to the birkhoff rott equation we subsequently derive a sufficient condition for linear instability of a circular vortex sheet for a family of generalized birkhoff rott kernels and prove that a common regularized kernel used in numerical simulation and analysis destabilizes the circular vortex sheet absent a destabilizing kernel regularization our work suggests that the nonlinear dynamics are critical for understanding circular vortex sheet instability and so the essential mechanism of the kelvin helmholtz instability is dependent on global vortex sheet geometry as expected nonlinear numerical simulations utilizing the regularized kernel exhibit unstable behavior finally we show experimental results which qualitatively match the types of instabilities that are observed numerically demonstrating the persistence of the kelvin helmholtz instability in real circular shear flows\",\"for the non rotating gaseous stars modeled by the euler poisson system with general pressure law lin and zeng proved a turning point principle which gives the linear stabilityinstability criteria for the non rotating gaseous stars in this paper we prove that the linear stability criterion for the non rotating stars also implies nonlinear orbital stability against general perturbations provided the weak solutions exist if the perturbations are further restricted to be spherically symmetric then nonlinear stability holds true unconditionally\",\"we consider a phase field model which describes the interactions between the blood flow and the thrombus the latter is supposed to be a viscoelastic material the potential describing the cohesive energy of the mixture is assumed to be of flory huggins type ie logarithmic this ensures the boundedness from below of the dissipation energy in the two dimensional case we prove the local in time existence and uniqueness of a strong solution provided that the two viscosities of the pure fluid phases are close enough we also show that the order parameter remains strictly separated from the pure phases if it is so at the initial time\",\"one of the characteristic features of turbulent flows is the emergence of many vortices which interact deform and intersect generating chaotic movement the evolution of a pair of vortices eg condensation trails of a plane can be considered as a basic element of a turbulent flow this simple example nevertheless demonstrates very rich behavior which still lacks a complete explanation we present a new model describing these phenomena based on the approximation of an infinitely thin vortex which allows us to focus on the chaotic movement of the vortex center line the main advantage of the developed model consists in the ability to go beyond the reconnection time and to see the coherent structures they turn to be very reminiscent to the ones obtained from the local induction approximation applied to a polygonal vortex it can be considered as an evidence that a pair of vortices creates a corner singularity in the reconnection point\",\"the existence of a local curve of corotating and counter rotating vortex pairs was proven by hmidi and mateu in via a desingularization of a pair of point vortices in this paper we construct a global continuation of these local curves that is we consider solutions which are more than a mere perturbation of a trivial solution indeed while the local analysis relies on the study of the linear equation at the trivial solution the global analysis requires on a deeper understanding of topological properties of the nonlinear problem for our proof we adapt the powerful analytic global bifurcation theorem due to buffoni and toland to allow for the singularity at the bifurcation point for both the corotating and the counter rotating pairs along the global curve of solutions either the angular fluid velocity vanishes or the two patches self intersect\",\"we revisit yudovichs well posedness result for the dimensional euler equations for an inviscid incompressible fluid on either a sufficiently regular not necessarily bounded open set or on the torus  we construct global in time weak solutions with vorticity in and in  where and are suitable uniformly localized versions of the lebesgue space and of the yudovich space respectively with no condition at infinity for the growth function  we also provide an explicit modulus of continuity for the velocity depending on the growth function  we prove uniqueness of weak solutions in under the assumption that grows moderately at infinity in contrast to yudovichs energy method we employ a lagrangian strategy to show uniqueness our entire argument relies on elementary real variable techniques with no use of either sobolev spaces calderon zygmund theory or littlewood paley decomposition and actually applies not only to the biot savart law but also to more general operators whose kernels obey some natural structural assumptions\",\"the rotating shallow water equations with f plane approximation and nonlinear bottom drag are a prototypical model for mid latitude geophysical flow that experience energy loss through simple topography motivated by numerical schemes for large scale geophysical flow we consider this model on the whole space with horizontal kinetic energy backscatter source terms built from negative viscosity and stabilizing hyperviscosity with constant parameters we study its interplay with linear and non smooth quadratic bottom drag through the existence of coherent flows our results highlight that backscatter can have undesired amplification and selection effects generating obstacles to energy distribution we find that decreasing linear bottom drag destabilizes the trivial flow and generates nonlinear flows that can be associated with geostrophic equilibria ge and inertia gravity waves igws the igws are periodic travelling waves while the ge are stationary and can be studied by a plane wave reduction we show that for isotropic backscatter both bifurcate simultaneously and supercritically while for anisotropic backscatter the primary bifurcation are ge in all cases presence of non smooth quadratic bottom drag implies unusual scaling laws for the rigorous bifurcation analysis by lyapunov schmidt reduction care has to be taken due to this lack of smoothness and since the hyperviscous terms yield a lack of spectral gap at large wave numbers for purely smooth bottom drag we identify a class of explicit such flows that behave linearly within the nonlinear equations amplitudes can be steady and arbitrary or grow exponentially and unboundedly we illustrate the results by numerical computations and present extended branches in parameter space\",\"we derive rigorously the reduced dynamical laws for quantized vortex dynamics of the complex ginzburg landau equation on torus when the core size of vortex  the reduced dynamical laws of the complex ginzburg landau equation are governed by a mixed flow of gradient flow and hamiltonian flow which are both driven by a renormalized energy on torus finally some first integrals and analytic solutions of the reduced dynamical laws are discussed\",\"in this paper we first prove the global existence of strong solutions to d incompressible navier stokes equations with solenoidal initial data which writes in the cylindrical coordinates is of the form provided that is large enough in particular we prove that the corresponding solution has almost the same frequency for any positive time the main idea of the proof is first to write the solution in trigonometrical series in variable and estimate the coefficients separately in some scale invariant spaces then we handle a sort of weighted sum of these norms of the coefficients in order to close the a priori estimate of the solution furthermore we shall extend the above well posedness result for initial data which is a linear combination of axisymmetric data without swirl and infinitely many large mode trigonometric series in the angular variable\",\"we address the long time behavior of the boussinesq system coupling the navier stokes equations driven by density with the non diffusive equation for the density we construct solutions of the system justifying previously obtained a priori bounds\",\"we consider the cauchy problem for the incompressible navier stokes equations on the whole space  with initial value as in koch and tatarus theorem and with force where smallness of ensures existence of a mild solution in absence of initial value we study the interaction of the two solutions and discuss the existence of global solution for the complete problem ie in presence of initial value and forcing term under smallness assumptions in particular we discuss the interaction between koch and tataru solutions and lei lins solutions in  or solutions in the multiplier space \",\"for any we prove that there exists an initial velocity field with vorticity for which there are infinitely many bounded admissible solutions to the d euler equation this shows sharpness of the weak strong uniqueness principle as well as sharpness of yudovichs proof of uniqueness in the class of bounded admissible solutions the initial data are truncated power law vortices the construction is based on finding a suitable self similar subsolution and then applying the convex integration method in addition we extend it for and show that the energy dissipation rate of the subsolution vanishes at if and only if  which is the onsager critical exponent in terms of control on vorticity in d\",\"the aim of this paper is to address the convergence analysis of a finite volume scheme for the approximation of a stochastic non linear parabolic problem set in a bounded domain of and under homogeneous neumann boundary conditions the considered discretization is semi implicit in time and tpfa in space by adapting well known methods for the time discretization of stochastic pdes one shows that the associated finite volume approximation converges towards the unique variational solution of the continuous problem strongly in \",\"in this paper we study the zero viscosity limit of the compressible navier stokes equations in a half space with non slip boundary condition we justify the prandtl boundary layer expansion for the analytic data the compressible navier stokes equations can be approximated by the compressible euler equations away from the boundary and by the compressible prandtl equation near the boundary\",\"the present paper is devoted to the proof of time decay estimates for derivatives at any order of finite energy global solutions of the navier stokes equations in general two dimensional domains these estimates only depend on the order of derivation and on the l norm of the initial data the same elementary method just based on energy estimates and ladyzhenskaya inequality also leads to gevrey regularity results\",\"we consider incompressible euler equations in any dimension imposing axisymmetric symmetry without swirl while the global regularity of smooth flows in this setting has been well known in  the same question in higher dimensions remains unsolved very recently global regularity for the case with some extra decay assumption on vorticity is obtained by proving global estimate of the radial velocity now we prove that the vorticity with single sign and a similar decay assumption is globally regular for any  this is due to pointwise decay estimate of radial velocity in sufficiently large radial distance which depends on time the result is of confinement type for support growth which is going back to marchioro comm math phys   and iftimie sideris gamblin comm partial differential equations   for  in particular we follow the approach of maffei marchioro rend sem mat univ padova   for so that we generalize the confinement into any dimension\",\"this work examines the dynamics of density patches in the d zero diffusivity boussinesq system modified such that momentum is in a large prandtl number balance we establish the global well posedness of this system for compactly supported and bounded initial densities and then examine the regularity of the evolving boundary of patch solutions for  we prove the global in time persistence of regularity where  for the density patch boundary via estimates of singular integrals we conclude with a simulation of an initially circular density patch via a level set method the simulated patch boundary forms corner like structures with growing curvature and yet our analysis shows the curvature will be bounded for all finite times\",\"in this paper semi discrete numerical scheme for the approximation of the periodic vlasov viscous burgers system is developed and analyzed the scheme is based on the coupling of discontinuous galerkin approximations for the vlasov equation and local discontinuous galerkin approximations for the viscous burgers equation both these methods use generalized numerical fluxes the proposed scheme is both mass and momentum conservative based on generalized gauss radau projections optimal rates of convergence in the case of smooth compactly supported initial data are derived finally computational results confirm our theoretical findings\",\"in this paper we consider the d incompressible navier stokes equations on the torus it is well known that for any divergence free initial data there exists a global smooth solution that is unique in the class of weak solutions we show that such uniqueness would fail in the class if  the non unique solutions we constructed are almost critical in the sense that they are uniformly continuous in for every  the kinetic energy agrees with any given smooth positive profile except on a set of arbitrarily small measure in time\",\"for the incompressible navier stokes equations in with low viscosity  we consider the cauchy problem with initial vorticity that represents an infinitely thin vortex filament of arbitrary given strength supported on a circle the vorticity field of the solution is smooth at any positive time and corresponds to a vortex ring of thickness that is translated along its symmetry axis due to self induction an effect anticipated by helmholtz in and quantified by kelvin in  for small viscosities we show that is well approximated on a large time interval by  where is the solution of the heat equation with initial data  and is the instantaneous velocity given by kelvins formula this gives a rigorous justification of the binormal motion for circular vortex filaments in weakly viscous fluids the proof relies on the construction of a precise approximate solution using a perturbative expansion in self similar variables to verify the stability of this approximation one needs to rule out potential instabilities coming from very large advection terms in the linearized operator this is done by adapting v i arnolds geometric stability methods developed in the inviscid case to the slightly viscous situation it turns out that although the geometric structures behind arnolds approach are no longer preserved by the equation for  the relevant quadratic forms behave well on larger subspaces than those originally used in arnolds theory and interact favorably with the viscous terms\",\"we prove global well posedness of the ocean primitive equations coupled to advection diffusion equations of the oceanic tracers temperature and salinity that are supplemented by the eddy parametrization model due to gent mcwilliams and redi this parametrization forms a milestone in global ocean modelling and constitutes a central part of any general ocean circulation model computation the eddy parametrization adds a secondary transport velocity to the tracer equation and renders the original laplacian operators in the advection diffusion equations nonlinear with a diffusion matrix that depends via the equation of state in a nonlinear fashion on both tracers simultaneously the eddy parametrization of gent mcwilliams redi augments the complexity of the mathematical analysis of the whole system which we present here we show first that weak solutions exist globally in time provided the parametrization uses a regularized density then we prove by a detailed analysis of the eddy operators the global well posedness our results apply also to the small slope approximation that is commonly used in global ocean simulations\",\"in this paper we study an interaction problem between a compressible viscous fluid and a nonlinear viscoelastic solid fully immersed in the fluid coupled together on the interface surface the solid is allowed to have self contact or contact with the rigid boundary of the fluid container for this problem a global weak solution with defect measure is constructed by using a multi layered approximation scheme which decouples the body and the fluid by penalizing the fluid velocity and allowing the fluid to pass through the body while the body is supplemented with a contact penalization term the resulting defect measure is a consequence of pressure concentrations that can appear where the fluid meets the generally irregular points of self contact of the solid moreover we study some geometrical properties of the fluid structure interface and the contact surface in particular we prove a lower bound on area of the interface\",\"steady surface waves in a two dimensional channel are considered we study bifurcations which occur on a branch of stokes water waves starting from a uniform stream solution two types of bifurcations are considered bifurcations in the class of stokes waves stokes bifurcation and bifurcations in a class of periodic waves with the period m times the period of the stokes wave m subharmonic bifurcation if we consider the first stokes bifurcation point then there are no m subharmonic bifurcations before this point and there exists m subharmonic bifurcation points after the first stokes bifurcation for sufficiently large m which approach the stokes bifurcation point when m tends to infinity moreover the set of m subharmonic bifurcating solutions is a closed connected continuum we give also a more detailed description of this connected set in terms of the set of its limit points which must contain extreme waves or overhanging waves or solitary waves or waves with stagnation on the bottom or stokes bifurcation points different from the initial one\",\"this is part ii of our paper in which we prove finite time blowup of the d boussinesq and d axisymmetric euler equations with smooth initial data of finite energy and boundary in part i of our paper chenhoua we establish an analytic framework to prove stability of an approximate self similar blowup profile by a combination of a weighted norm and a weighted norm under the assumption that the stability constants which depend on the approximate steady state satisfy certain inequalities stated in our stability lemma we prove stable nearly self similar blowup of the d boussinesq and d euler equations with smooth initial data and boundary in part ii of our paper we provide sharp stability estimates of the linearized operator by constructing space time solutions with rigorous error control we also obtain sharp estimates of the velocity in the regular case using computer assistance these results enable us to verify that the stability constants obtained in part i chenhoua indeed satisfy the inequalities in our stability lemma this completes the analysis of the finite time singularity of the axisymmetric euler equations with smooth initial data and boundary\",\"in this paper we mainly study the turbulence of galerkin truncations of d navier stokes equation under degenerate stochastic forcing and large scale

horseshoes\",\"we study the shock structure and the sub shocks formation in a binary mixture of rarefied polyatomic gases considering the dissipation only due to the dynamic pressure we classify the regions depending on the concentration and the mach number for which there may exist the sub shock in the profile of shock structure in one or both constituents or not for prescribed values of the mass ratio of the constituents and the ratios of the specific heats we compare the regions with the ones of the corresponding mixture of eulerian gases and we perform the numerical calculations of the shock structure for typical cases previously classified and confirm whether sub shocks emerge\",\"we consider a bounded domain and a rigid body moving inside a viscous compressible newtonian fluid we exploit the roughness of the body to show that the solid collides its container in finite time we investigate the case when the boundary of the body is of regularity and show that collision can happen for some suitable range of  we also discuss some no collision results for the smooth body case\",\"the mixed convection flow in a plane channel with adiabatic boundaries is examined the boundaries have an externally prescribed relative velocity defining a couette like setup for the flow a stationary flow regime is maintained with a constant velocity difference between the boundaries considered as thermally insulated the effect of viscous dissipation induces a heat source in the flow domain and hence a temperature gradient the nonuniform temperature distribution causes in turn a buoyancy force and a combined forced and free flow regime dual mixed convection flows occur for a given velocity difference their structure is analysed where in general only one branch of the dual flows is compatible with the oberbeck boussinesq approximation for realistic values of the gebhart number a linear stability analysis of the basic stationary flows with viscous dissipation is carried out the stability eigenvalue problem is solved numerically leading to the determination of the neutral stability curves and the critical values of the peclet number for different gebhart numbers an analytical asymptotic solution in the special case of perturbations with infinite wavelength is also developed\",\"using a weak convergence approach we establish a large deviation principle ldp for the solutions of fluid dynamic systems in two dimensional bounded domains subjected to no slip boundary conditions and perturbed by additive noise our analysis considers the convergence of both viscosity and noise intensity to zero specifically we focus on three important scenarios navier stokes equations in a kato type regime navier stokes equations for fluids with circularly symmetric flows and second grade fluid equations in all three cases we demonstrate the validity of the ldp taking into account the critical topology\",\"we consider alexander spirals with branches that is symmetric logarithmic spiral vortex sheets we show that such vortex sheets are linearly unstable in the kelvin helmholtz sense as solutions to the birkhoff rott equation to this end we consider fourier modes in a logarithmic variable to identify unstable solutions with polynomial growth in time\",\"we show that any unique global solution here we do not require any smallness condition beforehand to d axisymmetric navier stokes equations in some scaling invariant spaces must eventually become a small solution in particular we show that the limits of and are all as tends to infinity and by using this we can refine some decay estimates for the axisymmetric solutions\",\"we use a convex integration construction from in a baire category argument to show that weak solutions to the transport equation with incompressible vector fields with sobolev regularity are generic in the baire category sense using the construction of we prove an analog statement for the d navier stokes equations\",\"analysing the impact of bottom friction on shallow water waves over bottom terrains is important in areas including environmental and coastal engineering as well as the oceanic and atmospheric sciences however current theoretical developments rely on making certain limiting assumptions about these flows and thus more development is needed to be able to further generalise this behaviour this work uses adomian decomposition method adm to not only develop semi analytical formulations describing this behaviour for flat terrains but also as reverse engineering mechanisms to develop new closed form solutions describing this type of phenomena specifically we respectively focus on inertial geostrophic oscillations and anticyclonic vortices with finite escape times in which our results directly demonstrate the direct correlation between the constant coriolis force the constant bottom friction and the overall dynamics additionally we illustrate elements of dissipation induced instability with respect to constant bottom friction in these types of flows where we also demonstrate the connection to the initial dynamics for certain cases\",\"in this paper we consider an incompressible viscous fluid in an infinitely deep ocean being bounded above by a free moving boundary the governing equations are the gravity driven incompressible navier stokes equations with variable density and no surface tension is taken into account on the free surface after using the lagrangian transformation we write the main equations in a perturbed form in a fixed domain in the first part we describe a spectral analysis of the linearized equations around a hydrostatic equilibrium for a smooth increasing density profile  precisely we prove that there exist multiple normal modes to the linearized equations by following the operator method initiated by lafitte and nguyen  in the second part we study the nonlinear rayleigh taylor instability around the above profile by constructing a wide class of initial data for the nonlinear perturbation problem departing from the equilibrium based on the finding of multiple normal modes our nonlinear result follows the previous framework of guo and strauss and also of grenier with a refinement\",\"in this paper we establish the existence and stability of cylindrical transonic shock solutions under three dimensional perturbations of the incoming flows and the exit pressure without any further restrictions on the background transonic shock solutions the strength and position of the perturbed transonic shock are completely determined by the incoming flows and the exit pressure the optimal regularity is obtained for all physical quantities and the velocity the bernoullss function the entropy and the pressure share the same regularity the problem is reduced to solve a nonlinear free boundary value problem for a hyperbolic elliptic mixed system there are two main ingredients in our analysis one is to use the deformation curl decomposition to the steady euler system introduced by the authors in to effectively decouple the hyperbolic and elliptic modes another one is the reformulation of the rankine hugoniot conditions which determines the shock front by an algebraic equation and also gives an unusual second order differential boundary conditions on the shock front for the deformation curl system after homogenizing the curl system and introducing a potential function the solvability of the boundary value problem of the deformation curl system for the velocity field is reduced to a second order elliptic equation for the potential function with a nonlocal term involving only the trace of the potential function on the shock front this simplification follows essentially from an oblique boundary condition for the potential function on the shock front which is obtained by solving the poisson equation on the shock front with the homogeneous neumann boundary conditions on the intersection of the shock front and the cylinder walls\",\"in this paper we are concerned with bilinear estimates related to the two dimensional stationary navier stokes equation by establishing concrete counter examples we prove the bilinear estimates fail for almost all scaling critical besov spaces our result may be closely related to an open problem whether the two dimensional stationary navier stokes equation on the whole plane is well posed or ill posed in scaling critical besov spaces\",\"it is known that there has been classified for all homogeneous axisymmetric no swirl solutions of the three dimensional navier stokes equations with a possible singular ray the main purpose of this paper is to show that the least singular solutions among such solutions other than landau solutions to the navier stokes equations are asymptotically stable under perturbations moreover we establish the decay estimate with an explicit decay rate and a sharp constant for any  for that purpose we first study the global well posedness of solutions to the perturbed equations under small initial data in space and the local well posedness with any initial data in spaces for \",\"in recent years the scalar auxiliary variable sav approach has become very popular and hot in the design of linear high order and unconditional energy stable schemes of gradient flow models however the nature of sav based numerical schemes preserving modified energy dissipation limits its wider application a relaxation technique to correct the modified energy for the baseline sav method rsav was proposed by zhao et al and shen et al the rsav approach is unconditionally energy stable with respect to a modified energy that is closer to the original free energy and provides a much improved accuracy when compared with the sav approach in this paper inspired by the rsav approach we propose a novel technique to correct the modified energy of the sav approach which can be proved to be an optimal energy approximation we construct new high order implicit explicit schemes based on the proposed energy optimal sav eop sav approach the constructed eop sav schemes not only provide an improved accuracy but also simplify calculation and can be viewed as the optimal relaxation we also prove that the numerical schemes based on the eop sav approach are unconditionally energy stable compared with the rsav approach the proposed eop sav approach does not need introduce any relaxed factors and can share the similar procedure for error estimates several interesting numerical examples have been presented to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed methods\",\"we will prove that solutions of the allen cahn equations that satisfy the equipartition can be transformed into solutions of the euler equations with constant pressure as a consequence we obtain de giorgi type results that is the level sets of entire solutions are hyperplanes in addition we obtain some examples of smooth entire solutions of the euler equations in particular cases for specific type of initial conditions some of these solutions can be extended to the navier stokes equations also we will determine the structure of solutions of the allen cahn system in two dimensions that satisfy the equipartition finally we apply the leray projection on the allen cahn system and provide some explicit entire solutions\",\"in this paper we obtain uniformly rotating vorticity with sufficiently large angular velocity in the unit disk the solution consists of either a small nearly ellipse vortex patch which is highly concentrated near the origin or a configuration in which the another two vortical components are very close to the boundary of fluid domain the total vorticity are prescribed and the sizes of vortical domains are not necessarily small in the same order the construction which is based on a perturbation argument exhibits a subtle multiscale phenomenon in this highly rotating fluid\",\"we study the monotone energy stability of poiseuille flow in a plane parallel channel with a saturated porous medium modeled by the brinkman equation on the basis of an analogy with a magneto hydrodynamic problem hartmann flow cf   we prove that the least stabilizing perturbations in the energy norm are the two dimensional spanwise perturbations this result implies a squire theorem for monotone nonlinear energy stability moreover for reynolds numbers less than the critical reynolds number there can be no transient energy growth\",\"in this paper we consider the compressible navier stokes system around the constant equilibrium states and prove the unique existence of a global solution for arbitrarily large initial data in the scaling critical besov space provided that the mach number is sufficiently small and the incompressible part of the initial velocity generates the global solution of the incompressible navier stokes equation moreover we consider the low mach number limit and show that the compressible solution converges to the solution of the incompressible navier stokes equation in some space time norms\",\"in this paper we obtain the optimal instability threshold of the couette flow for navier stokes equations with small viscosity  when the perturbations are in the critical spaces  more precisely we introduce a new dynamical approach to prove the instability for some perturbation of size with any small  which implies that is the sharp stability threshold in our method we prove a transient exponential growth without referring to eigenvalue or pseudo spectrum as an application for the linearized euler equations around shear flows that are near the couette flow we provide a new tool to prove the existence of growing modes for the corresponding rayleigh operator and give a precise location of the eigenvalues\",\"this paper concerns the structural stability of subsonic flows with a contact discontinuity in a two dimensional finitely long slightly curved nozzle we establish the existence and uniqueness of subsonic flows with a contact discontinuity by prescribing the entropy function the bernoulli quantity and the horizontal mass flux distribution at the entrance and the flow angle at the exit the problem can be formulated as a free boundary problem for the hyperbolic elliptic coupled system to deal with the free boundary value problem the lagrangian transformation is employed to straighten the contact discontinuity the euler system is reduced to a nonlinear second order equation for the stream function inspired by  we use the implicit function theorem to locate the contact discontinuity we also need to develop an iteration scheme to solve a nonlinear elliptic boundary value problem with nonlinear boundary conditions in a weighted holder space\",\"we derive rigorously the reduced dynamical laws for quantized vortex dynamics of the nonlinear schrodinger equation on torus with non vanishing momentum when the vortex core size epsilon to  the reduced dynamical laws are governed by a hamiltonian flow driven by a renormalized energy a key ingredient is to construct a new canonical harmonic map to include the effect from the non vanishing momentum into the dynamics finally some properties of the reduced dynamical law are discussed\",\"in this paper we are concerned with the d incompressible navier stokes equations driven by space time white noise we establish existence of infinitely many global in time probabilistically strong and analytically weak solutions for every divergence free initial condition  more precisely there exist infinitely many solutions such that for some  where is the solution to the linear equation this result in particular implies non uniqueness in law our result is sharp in the sense that the solution satisfying for some is unique\",\"we study the drainage of a viscous liquid film coating outside a horizontal cylinder we first study the evolution of the axially invariant draining flow initiated at rest with uniform film thickness  non linear simulations indicate that for each  there is a threshold in the bond number  which compares the gravitational effects with surface tension above which the draining liquid bulk ruptures this critical is found to scale inversely with  defining the existence of a quasi stationary pendant curtain sustained below the cylinder by surface tension the interface of the pendant curtain is unconditionally linearly unstable and is prone to rayleigh plateau like capillarity driven and rayleigh taylor gravity driven instabilities the linear stability of the quasi static state along with an energy analysis of the unstable mode illustrates that while the rayleigh taylor instability is always present capillary effects dominate the instability at small  which promotes the formation of pearls enveloping the cylinder in contrast at large  capillarity acts in a stabilising way and the instability is purely gravity driven forming underside modulations we present the asymptotic energy repartition representing the different physical mechanisms at play in the instability of the saturated curtains for a wide range of  the results of the linear analysis agree with the pre existing experiments ofciteauthorbruyn and non linear simulations ofciteauthorweidner on thin film and extend the results for thick films additionally based on the volume made available for droplet growth by the development of the most linearly amplified wavelength we build a tentative regime diagram predicting the final patterns emerging from the pendant curtain an array of pearls or pendant drops or three dimensional droplet pinch off\",\"in this paper we study the stability two dimensional d steady euler flows with sharply concentrated vorticity in a simply connected bounded domain these flows are obtained as maximizers of the kinetic energy subject to the constraint that the vorticity is compactly supported in a finite number of disjoint regions of small diameter we prove the nonlinear stability of these flows when the vorticity is concentrated in one small region or in two small regions with opposite signs the proof is achieved by showing that these flows constitute a compact and isolated set of local maximizers of the kinetic energy on an isovortical surface the separation property of the stream function plays a crucial role in validating the isolatedness\",\"we address a physically meaningful extension of the prandtl system also known as hyperbolic prandtl equations we show that the linearised model around a non monotonic shear flow is ill posed in any sobolev spaces indeed shortly in time we generate solutions that experience a dispersion relation of order k in the frequencies of the tangential direction akin the pioneering result of gerard varet and dormy in  for prandtl where the dispersion was of order k we emphasise however that this growth rate does not imply ill posedness in gevrey class m with m  and we relate also these aspects to the original prandtl equations in gevrey class m with m   by relaxing certain assumptions on the shear flow and on the solutions namely allowing for unbounded flows in the vertical direction we however determine a suitable shear flow for the mentioned ill posedness in gevrey spaces\",\"we investigate diffusion driven flows in a parallel plate channel domain with linear density stratification which arise from the combined influence of gravity and diffusion in density stratified fluids we compute the time dependent diffusion driven flows and perturbed density field using eigenfunction expansions under the boussinesq approximation in channel domain the unsteady flow converges to a steady state solution either monotonically or non monotonically highly oscillatory depending on the relation between the schmidt number and the non dimensionalized stratified scalar diffusivity while the flow in the half space inclined plane problem exhibits oscillatory convergence for all parameters to validate the boussinesq approximation we propose the quasi boussinesq approximation which includes transverse density variation in the inertial term numerical solutions show that the relative difference between the boussinesq and quasi boussinesq approximations is uniformly small we also study the mixing of a passive tracer induced by the advection of the unsteady diffusion driven flow and present the series representation of the time dependent effective diffusion coefficient for small schmidt numbers the effective diffusion coefficient induced by the unsteady flow solution can oscillate with an amplitude larger than the effective diffusion coefficient induced by the long time limiting steady state flow interestingly the unsteady flow solution can reduce the time dependent effective diffusion coefficient temporally in some parameter regimes below even that produced by pure molecular diffusion in the absence of a flow however at long times the effective diffusion is significantly enhanced for large peclet numbers\",\"motivated by the foam displacement in porous media with linear adsorption we extended the existing framework for two phase flow containing an active tracer described by a non strictly hyperbolic system of conservation laws we solved the global riemann problem by presenting possible wave sequences that composed this solution although the problems are well posedness for all riemann data there is a parameter region where the solution lacks structural stability we verified that the model implemented on the most used commercial solver for geoscience cmg stars describing foam displacement in porous media with adsorption satisfies the hypotheses to apply the developed theory resulting in structural stability loss for some parameter regions\",\"in this paper we prove the existence of smooth initial data for the two dimensional free boundary incompressible viscous magnetohydrodynamics mhd equations for which the interface remains regular but collapses into a splash singularity self intersects in at least one point in finite time the existence of the splash singularities is guaranteed by a local existence theorem in which we need suitable spaces for the modified magnetic field and modification of the velocity and the pressure such that the modified initial velocity is zero and a stability result which allows us to construct a class of initial velocities and domains for an arbitrary initial magnetic field it turns out that the presence of the magnetic field does not prevent the viscous fluid to form splash singularities for certain smooth initial data\",\"we consider an initial boundary value problem for the d navier stokes equations posed on bounded smooth domains we prove the existence and uniqiueness of regular solutions as well as their exponential decay and additional regularity properties have been established assuming restrictions on initial data\",\"the link between compressible models of tissue growth and the hele shaw free boundary problem of fluid mechanics has recently attracted a lot of attention in most of these models only repulsive forces and advection terms are taken into account in order to take into account long range interactions we include for the first time a surface tension effect by adding a nonlocal term which leads to the degenerate nonlocal cahn hilliard equation and study the incompressible limit of the system the degeneracy and the source term are the main difficulties our approach relies on a new linfty estimate obtained by de giorgi iterations and on a uniform control of the energy despite the source term we also prove the long term convergence to a single constant stationary state of any weak solution using entropy methods even when a source term is present our result shows that the surface tension in the nonlocal and even local cahn hilliard equation will not prevent the tumor from completely invading the domain\",\"we show the global existence of a weak solution for the navier stokes equations for compressible fluids with slip boundary conditions of friction type\",\"the rayleigh and orr sommerfeld equations are odes which arise from the linearized euler and navier stokes equation around a shear flow in this paper we consider the adjoints of the rayleigh and orr sommerfeld equations on with respect to the complex product in the viscous case we consider a family of viscosity dependent navier boundary conditions which in the limit corresponds to the no slip condition we rigorously establish existence and asymptotic properties of their eigenvalues eigenmodes and green functions away from critical layers the adjoint operators prove useful because they also allow us to deduce properties about the kernels and images of the original operators\",\"we consider the steady stokes equations in a bounded domain with forcing in divergence form supplemented with no slip boundary conditions we provide a maximal regularity theory in campanato spaces inlcuding and for as special cases under minimal assumptions on the regularity of the underlying domain our approach is based on pointwise multipliers in campanto spaces\",\"in this paper we prove full local well posedness for the cauchy problem for the compressible d euler equation ie local existence uniqueness and continuous dependence on initial data with initial velocity density and vorticity  improving on the regularity conditions of  the continuous dependence on initial data for rough solutions of the compressible euler system is new even with the same regularity conditions as in  in addition we prove new local well posedness results for the d compressible euler system with entropy\",\"the tollmien schlichting t s waves play a key role in the early stages of boundary layer transition in a breakthrough work grenier guo and nguyen gave the first rigorous construction of the t s waves of temporal mode for the incompressible fluid yang and zhang recently made an important contribution by constructing the compressible t s waves of temporal mode for certain boundary layer profiles with mach number  in this paper we construct the t s waves of both temporal mode and spatial mode to the linearized compressible navier stokes system around the boundary layer flow in the whole subsonic regime  including the blasius profile our approach is based on a novel iteration scheme between the quasi incompressible and quasi compressible systems with a key ingredient being the solution of an orr sommerfeld type equation using a new airy airy rayleigh iteration instead of rayleigh airy iteration introduced by grenier guo and nguyen we believe the method developed in this work can be applied in solving other related problems for subsonic flows\",\"we consider the incompressible navier stokes equations in a moving domain whose boundary is prescribed by a function with  of low regularity this is motivated by problems from fluid structure interaction we prove partial boundary regularity for boundary suitable weak solutions assuming that is continuous in time with values in the fractional sobolev space for some and we have for some  the existence of boundary suitable weak solutions is a consequence of a new maximal regularity result for the stokes equations in moving domains which is of independent interest\",\"higher order finite difference weighted essentially non oscillatory weno schemes have been constructed for conservation laws for multidimensional problems they offer high order accuracy at a fraction of the cost of a finite volume weno or dg scheme of comparable accuracy this makes them quite attractive for several science and engineering applications but to the best of our knowledge such schemes have not been extended to non linear hyperbolic systems with non conservative products in this paper we perform such an extension which improves the domain of applicability of such schemes the extension is carried out by writing the scheme in fluctuation form we use the hlli riemann solver of dumbser and balsara  as a building block for carrying out this extension because of the use of an hll building block the resulting scheme has a proper supersonic limit the use of anti diffusive fluxes ensures that stationary discontinuities can be preserved by the scheme thus expanding its domain of applicability our new finite difference weno formulation uses the same weno reconstruction that was used in classical versions making it very easy for users to transition over to the present formulation for conservation laws the new finite difference weno is shown to perform as well as the classical version of finite difference weno with two major advantages  it can capture jumps in stationary linearly degenerate wave families exactly  it only requires the reconstruction to be applied once several examples from hyperbolic pde systems with non conservative products are shown which indicate that the scheme works and achieves its design order of accuracy for smooth multidimensional flows stringent riemann  abstract truncated see pdf\",\"we prove the stability of three dimensional axisymmetric solutions to the steady euler system with transonic shocks in divergent nozzles under perturbations of the exit pressure and the supersonic solution in the upstream region we first derive a free boundary problem with the newly introduced formulation of the euler system for three dimensional axisymmetric flows in divergent nozzles via the method of helmholtz decomposition we then construct an iteration scheme and use the schauder fixed point theorem and weak implicit function theorem to solve the problem\",\"whether there exist finite time blow up solutions for the d boussinesq and the d euler equations are of fundamental importance to the field of fluid mechanics we develop a new numerical framework employing physics informed neural networks pinns that discover for the first time a smooth self similar blow up profile for both equations the solution itself could form the basis of a future computer assisted proof of blow up for both equations in addition we demonstrate pinns could be successfully applied to find unstable self similar solutions to fluid equations by constructing the first example of an unstable self similar solution to the cordoba cordoba fontelos equation we show that our numerical framework is both robust and adaptable to various other equations\",\"we examine the power series solutions of two classical nonlinear ordinary differential equations of fluid mechanics that are mathematically related by their large distance asymptotic behaviors in semi infinite domains the first problem is that of the sakiadis boundary layer over a moving flat wall for which no exact analytic solution has been put forward the second problem is that of a static air liquid meniscus with surface tension that intersects a flat wall at a given contact angle and limits to a flat pool away from the wall for the latter problem the exact analytic solution given as distance from the wall as function of meniscus height has long been known batchelor  here we provide an explicit solution as meniscus height vs distance from the wall to elucidate structural similarities to the sakiadis boundary layer although power series solutions are readily obtainable to the governing nonlinear ordinary differential equations we show that in both problems the series diverge due to non physical complex or negative real valued singularities in both cases these singularities can be moved by expanding in exponential gauge functions motivated by their respective large distance asymptotic behaviors to enable series convergence over their full semi infinite domains for the sakiadis problem this not only provides a convergent taylor series and conjectured exact solution to the ode but also a means to evaluate the wall shear parameter and other properties to within any desired precision although the nature of nonlinear odes precludes general conclusions our results indicate that asymptotic behaviors can be useful when proposing variable transformations to overcome power series divergence\",\"we develop a quantitative microscopic theory of decaying turbulence by studying the dimensional reduction of the navier stokes loop equation for the velocity circulation we have found an infinite dimensional manifold of solutions of the navier stokes loop equation for the wilson loop in decaying turbulence in arbitrary dimension  this family of solutions corresponds to a fractal curve in complex space  described by an algebraic equation between consecutive positions the probability measure is explicitly constructed in terms of products of conventional measures for orthogonal group and a sphere  in three dimensions  we compute the step size pdf with fat tail  we also compute the enstrophy pdf with fat tail  corresponding to an infinite mean value anomalous dissipation the energy density of the fluid decays as  where is an initial dissipation rate presumably we have found a new phase of extreme turbulence not yet observed in real or numerical experiments\",\"in the note the euler scaling is used to study a certain scenario of potential type ii blowups of solutions to the navier stokes equations\",\"we study the point spectrum of the linearisation of eulers equation for the ideal fluid on the torus about a shear flow by separation of variables the problem is reduced to the spectral theory of a complex hills equation using hills determinant an evans function of the original euler equation is constructed the evans function allows us to completely characterise the point spectrum of the linearisation and to count the isolated eigenvalues with non zero real part we prove that the number of discrete eigenvalues of he linearised operator for a specific shear flow is exactly twice the number of non zero integer lattice points inside the so called unstable disk\",\"the squires theorem holds for parallel shear flows governed by the linearized navier stokes equations squire writes for the study of the stability of flow between parallel walls it is sufficient to confine attention to disturbances of two dimensional type squire citep squire instead for nonlinear navier stokes system it is supposed that the theorem does not hold in general see drazin and reid citepp drazinreid here we prove that the squire theorem holds also for nonlinear monotone energy stability of parallel shear flows that include couette and poiseuille flows between parallel walls\",\"this paper concerns the sharp interface limit of solutions to the inhomogeneous incompressible navier stokesallen cahn coupled system in a bounded domain  based on a relative energy method we prove that the solutions to the navier stokesallen cahn system converge to the corresponding solutions to a sharp interface model provided that the thickness of the diffuse interfacial zone goes to zero it is noted that the relative energy method can avoid both the spectral estimates of the linearized allen cahn operator and the construction of approximate solutions by the matched asymptotic expansion method in the study of the sharp interface limit process and some suitable functionals are designed and estimated by elaborated energy methods accordingly\",\"in this article we prove the existence of global solutions to the inhomogeneous incompressible navier stokes equations whenever the initial velocity belongs to some subspace of  and the initial density is sufficiently close to in the uniform metric this is a natural extension to the variable density case of the celebrated result by h koch and d tataru concerning the classical navier stokes equations\",\"we develop a theory of enhanced diffusivity and skewness of the longitudinal distribution of a diffusing tracer advected by a periodic time varying shear flow in a straight channel although applicable to general fluid flow we restrict the examples of our theory to the tracer advected by flows that are induced by a periodically oscillating wall in a newtonian fluid between two infinite parallel plates as well as flow in an infinitely long duct we first derived the formula of the flow produced by the wall motions second we calculate the second aris moment for all time and its long time limiting effective diffusivity as a function of the geometrical parameters frequency viscosity and diffusivity using a new formalism based upon the helmholtz operator we establish a new single series formula for the variance we show that the viscous dominated limit results in a linear shear layer for which the effective diffusivity is bounded for finite viscosities the enhanced diffusion diverges in the high frequency limit we present a study of the effective diffusivity surface as a function of the non dimensional parameters which shows how a maximum can exist for various parameter sweeps physical experiments are performed in water using particle tracking velocimetry to quantitatively measure the fluid flow using fluorescein dye as the passive tracer we document that the theory is quantitatively accurate specifically image analysis suggests that the distribution variance be measured using the full width at half maximum is robust to noise further we show that the scalar skewness is zero for linear shear flows at all times whereas for the nonlinear stokes layer the skewness sign can be controlled through the oscillating phase last for single frequency wall motion the long time skewness decays at the faster rate as compared with the case with steady flow\",\"we establish the optimal convergence rate to the hypersonic similarity law which is also called the mach number independence principle for steady compressible full euler flows over two dimensional slender lipschitz wedges the problem can be formulated as the comparison of the entropy solutions in between the two initial boundary value problems for the compressible full euler equations with parameter and the hypersonic small disturbance equations with curved characteristic boundaries we establish the convergence estimate of these two solutions with the optimal convergence rate which justifies van dykes similarity theory rigorously for the compressible full euler flows this is the first mathematical result on the comparison of two solutions of the compressible euler equations with characteristic boundary conditions to achieve this we first employ the special structures of the two systems and establish the global existence and the stability of the entropy solutions under the smallness assumptions on the total variation of both the initial data and the tangential slope of the wedge boundary based on the stability properties of the approximate solutions to the scaled equations with parameter  a uniform lipschtiz continuous map with respect to the initial data and the wedge boundary is obtained next we compare the solutions given by the riemann solvers of the two systems by taking the boundary perturbations into account case by case then for a given fixed hypersonic similarity parameter as the mach number tends to infinity we establish the desired convergence estimate with the optimal convergence rate finally we show the optimality of the convergence rate by investigating a special solution\",\"this paper is concerned with the convergence rates of subsonic flows for airfoil problem and infinite long largely open nozzle problem which is an improvement of  the maximum principle is applied to estimate the potential function by choosing the proper compared functions then by the weighted schauder estimates the convergence rates of velocity at the far field are shown as  furthermore we construct the examples to show the optimality of our convergence rates and the expansion of the incompressible airfoil flow at infinity indicating the higher convergence rates \",\"in this paper we prove the singularity formation for poiseuille laminar flow of full ericksen leslie system modeling nematic liquid crystal flows in dimension two the singularity is due to the geometric effect at the origin\",\"we study the scaled anisotropic co rotational beris edwards system modeling the hydrodynamic motion of nematic liquid crystals in dimension two we prove the global well posedness with small analytic data in a thin strip domain moreover we justify the limit to a system involving the hydrostatic navier stokes system

reference state that in finite time cease to be differentiable\",\"we study the symmetric stochastic stokes system  in a bounded domain the results are two folded first we show that in the context of analytically weak solutions the stochastic pressure related to non divergence free stochastic forces enjoys almost temporal derivatives on a besov scale second we verify that the velocity component of strong solutions obeys temporal derivatives in an exponential nikolskii space moreover we prove that the non linear symmetric gradient   has temporal derivatives in a nikolskii space\",\"we consider  homogeneous solutions to the stationary incompressible euler equations in for and in for  shvydkoy  demonstrated the nonexistence of  homogeneous solutions and  homogeneous solutions in the range for the beltrami and axisymmetric flows the nonexistence result of the beltrami  homogeneous solutions holds for all  we show the nonexistence of axisymmetric  homogeneous solutions without swirls for  the main result of this study is the existence of axisymmetric  homogeneous solutions in the complementary range  more specifically we show the existence of axisymmetric beltrami  homogeneous solutions for and axisymmetric  homogeneous solutions with a nonconstant bernoulli function for  this is the first existence result on  homogeneous solutions with no explicit forms for  constructed  homogeneous solutions provide new examples of the beltramieuler flows in whose level sets of the proportionality factorbernoulli surfaces are nested surfaces created by the rotation of the sign \",\"a fundamental open problem in fluid dynamics is whether solutions to d euler equations with valued vorticity are unique for some  a related question more probabilistic in flavour is whether one can find a physically relevant noise regularizing the pde we present some substantial advances towards a resolution of the latter by establishing well posedness in law for solutions with valued vorticity and finite kinetic energy for a general class of stochastic d fluid dynamical equations the noise is spatially rough and of kraichnan type and we allow the presence of a deterministic forcing  this class includes as primary examples logarithmically regularized d euler and hypodissipative d navier stokes equations in the first case our result solves the open problem posed by flandoli in the latter case for well chosen forcing  the corresponding deterministic pde without noise has recently been shown by albritton and colombo to be ill posed consequently the addition of noise truly improves the solution theory for such pde\",\"we are concerned with a one dimensional flow of a compressible fluid which may be seen as a simplification of the flow of fluid in a long thin pipe we assume that the pipe is on one side ended by a spring the other side of the pipe is let open there we assume either inflow or outflow boundary conditions such situation can be understood as a toy model for human

simple lie groups endowed with a samelson complex structure  in particular we show that if is determined by some maximal torus and is a left invariant hermitian metric which is also invariant under the right action of the torus  and is both cyt and skt then has to be bismut flat\",\"we study an eigenvalue problem for the laplacian on a compact kahler manifold considering the th eigenvalue as a functional on the space of kahler metrics with fixed volume on a compact complex manifold we introduce the notion of extremal kahler metric we deduce a condition for a kahler metric to be extremal as examples we consider product kahler manifolds compact isotropy irreducible homogeneous kahler manifolds and flat complex tori\",\"we give a complete description of the vertex algebra of global sections of the chiral de rham complex of an arbitrary compact ricci flat kahler manifold\",\"we investigate compact complex manifolds endowed with skt or balanced metrics in each case we define a new functional whose critical points are proved to be precisely the kahler metrics if any on the manifold as general manifolds of either type need not admit kahler metrics this provides an approach to new obstructions to kahlerianity within these two families of metrics\",\"the cohomology groups of line bundles over complex tori or abelian varieties are classically studied invariants of these spaces in this article we compute the cohomology groups of line bundles over various holomorphic non commutative deformations of complex tori our analysis interpolates between two extreme cases the first case is a calculation of the space of cohomological theta functions for line bundles over constant commutative deformations the second case is a calculation of the cohomologies of non commutative deformations of degree zero line bundles\",\"the aim of this paper is to construct left invariant einstein pseudo riemannian sasaki metrics on solvable lie groups we consider the class of standard sasaki solvable lie algebras of dimension  which are in one to one correspondence with pseudo kahler nilpotent lie algebras of dimension endowed with a compatible derivation in a suitable sense we characterize the pseudo kahler structures and derivations giving rise to sasaki einstein metrics we classify standard sasaki solvable lie algebras of dimension and those whose pseudo kahler reduction is an abelian lie algebra the einstein metrics we obtain are standard but not of pseudo iwasawa type\",\"a principal torus bundle over a complex manifold with even dimensional fiber and characteristic class of type admits a family of generalized complex structures we show that such a generalized complex structure is equivalent to the product of the complex structure on the base and the symplectic structure on the fiber in a tubular neighborhood of the fiber this has consequences for the generalized dolbeault cohomology of the bundle\",\"in this paper we are concerned with studying the existence of invariant complex manifolds of two dimensional holomorphic systems from the geometric singular perturbation theory we know that if a slow fast system has associated a normally hyperbolic compact critical manifold then there exists a smooth locally invariant manifold however this smooth manifold does not necessarily have a complex structure here we provide conditions to guarantee the existence of one dimensional invariant complex manifolds consequently this allows us to establish that the centers foci and nodes of the reduced problem are persistent by singular perturbation the tools used by us are the usual techniques of fenichel and briot bouquet theories\",\"we compute the weyl group in the sense of segal of the group of holomorphic isometries of a kahler toric manifold with real analytic kahler metric\",\"we introduce a natural geometric approach to constructing moment maps in finite and infinite dimensional complex geometry this is applied to two settings kahler manifolds and holomorphic vector bundles our new approach exploits the existence of universal families and the theory of equivariant differential forms in the setting of kahler manifolds we first give a new geometric proof of donaldson fujikis moment map interpretation of the scalar curvature associated to arbitrary products of chern classes of the manifold namely to a central charge we then introduce a geometric pde determining a z critical kahler metric and show that these general equations also satisfy moment map properties on holomorphic vector bundles using a similar strategy we give a geometric proof of atiyah botts moment map interpretation of the hermitian yang mills condition we go on to give a new geometric proof that the pde determining a z critical connection associated to a choice of central charge on the category of coherent sheaves can be viewed as a moment map deformed hermitian yang mills connections are a special case in which our work gives a geometric proof of a result of collins yau our main assertion is that this is the canonical way of producing moment maps in complex geometry associated to any geometric problem along with a choice of stability condition and hence that this accomplishes one of the main steps towards producing pde counterparts to stability conditions in large generality\",\"in this paper we study the relative chow and stability of toric manifolds in the toric sense first we give a criterion for relative stability and instability of toric fano manifolds in the toric sense the reduction of relative chow stability on toric manifolds will be investigated using the hibert mumford criterion in two ways one is to consider the maximal torus action and its weight polytope we obtain a reduction by the strategy of ono ono which fits into the relative git stability detected by szekelyhidi the other way relies on actions and chow weights associated to toric degenerations following donaldson and ross thomas d rt as applications of our main theorem we partially determine the relative stability of toric fano threefolds and present counter examples which are relatively stable in the toric sense but which are asymptotically relatively chow unstable in the end we explain the erroneous parts of the published version of this article corresponding to sections  which provides some inconclusive results for relative stability in table \",\"we define a real version of smooth deligne cohomology for manifolds with involution which interpolates between equivariant sheaf cohomology and smooth imaginary valued forms our main result is a classification of real line bundles with real connection on manifolds with involution\",\"we introduce the concept of non archimedean metrics attached to a transcendental pseudoeffective cohomology class on a compact kahler manifold this is obtained via extending the ross witt nystrom correspondence to the relative case and we point out that our construction agrees with that of boucksom jonsson when the class is induced by a pseudoeffective line bundle we introduce the notion of a flag configuration attached to a transcendental big class recovering the notion of a test configuration in the ample case we show that non archimedean finite energy metrics are approximable by flag configurations and very general versions of the radial ding energy are continuous a novel result even in the ample case as applications we characterize the delta invariant as the ding semistability threshold of flag configurations and filtrations and prove a ytd type existence theorem in terms of flag configurations\",\"let be an dimensional polarized manifold let be a smooth hypersurface defined by a holomorphic section of  in this paper we show the existence of a complete kahler metric on whose scalar curvature is flat away from some divisor if there are positive integers such that the line bundle is very ample and the ratio is sufficiently small\",\"let be an dimensional polarized manifold let be a smooth hypersurface defined by a holomorphic section of  in this paper we study the existence of a complete scalar flat kahler metric on on the assumption that has a constant positive scalar curvature kahler metric\",\"we introduce the fiberwise bergman kernel for a flat family of polarized varieties over a riemann surface which extends the classical bergman kernel defined on the reduced fibers we establish the continuity of the fiberwise bergman kernel and provide a result on uniform convergence for the fubini study currents as a consequence we show that the fiberwise bergman kernel on test configurations exhibits continuity and the fubini study currents converge uniformly\",\"we introduce two notions of hyperbolicity for not necessarily kahler even balanced dimensional compact complex manifolds  the first called it skt hyperbolicity generalises gromovs kahler hyperbolicity by means of skt metrics the second called it gauduchon hyperbolicity by means of gauduchon metrics our first main result in this paper asserts that every skt hyperbolic is also kobayashibrody hyperbolic and every gauduchon hyperbolic is divisorially hyperbolic the second main result is to prove a vanishing theorem for the harmonic spaces on the universal cover of a skt hyperbolic manifold\",\"d brane solutions of type iib supergravity can be obtained by means a classical ansatz involving a harmonic warp factor and two summands the first being the flat minkowskian metric of the d brane world sheet and the second a ricci flat metric on a suitable dimensional transverse space both twisted by the warp factor of particular interest is the case of the total space of thecanonical bundle over a complex kahler fold this situation emerges in many cases while considering the resolution of finite quotient singulaties when the group is  the complex fold is the second hirzebruch surface endowed with a kahler metric having suxu isometry there is actually an entire class of such metrics parameterized by a single function and best described in the amsy symplectic formalism we recover the existence of a two parameter subclass of kahler einstein metrics on manifolds that are homeorphic to  and study in detail this class the kahler einstein nature of these manifolds allows the construction of the ricci flat metric on their canonical bundle via the calabi ansatz which we recast in the amsy formalism deriving some new elegant formulae furthermore we show the full integrability of the differential system of geodesics equations thanks to an additional conserved quantity that we unveil and which is similar to the carter constant in the case of the kerr metric\",\"we classify all the dimensional unimodular lie algebras admitting a complex structure with non zero closed form this gives rise to dimensional compact homogeneous spaces  where is a lattice admitting an invariant complex structure with holomorphically trivial canonical bundle as an application in the balanced hermitian case we study the instanton condition for any metric connection in the plane generated by the levi civita connection and the gauduchon line of hermitian connections in the setting of the hull strominger system with connection on the tangent bundle being hermitian yang mills we prove that if a compact non kahler homogeneous space admits an invariant solution with respect to some non flat connection in the family  then is a nilmanifold with underlying lie algebra  a solvmanifold with underlying algebra  or a quotient of the semisimple group sl

paper studies the asymptotic behavior of several central objects in dunkl theory as the dimension of the underlying space grows large our starting point is the observation that a recent result from the random matrix theory literature implies a large deviations principle for the hydrodynamic limit of radial dunkl processes using this fact we prove a variational formula for the large asymptotics of generalized bessel functions as well as a large deviations principle for the more general family of radial heckman opdam processes as an application we prove a theorem on the asymptotic behavior of weight multiplicities of irreducible representations of arbitrary compact or complex lie algebras in the limit of large rank the theorems in this paper generalize several known results describing analogous asymptotics for dyson brownian motion spherical matrix integrals and kostka numbers\",\"spin glass models involving multiple replicas with constrained overlaps have been studied in fpv pt pana for the spherical versions of these models ko ko showed that the limiting free energy is given by a parisi type minimization in this work we show that for sherrington kirkpatrick ie spin interactions it can also be expressed in terms of a thouless andersson palmer tap variational principle this is only the second spin glass model where a mathematically rigorous tap computation of the free energy at all temperatures and external fields has been achieved the variational formula we derive here also confirms that the model is replica symmetric a fact which is natural but not obviously deducible from its parisi formula\",\"in this paper we consider bernoulli percolation on a locally finite transitive and infinite graph eg the hypercubic lattice  we prove the following estimate where is the probability that there is a path of open edges from to the sphere of radius   forall pin forall mn ge  quad thetan p thetample cfracthetanpnm  this result implies that decays exponentially fast in the subcritical phase it also implies the mean field lower bound in the supercritical phase we thus provide a new proof of the sharpness of the phase transition for bernoulli percolation contrary to the previous proofs of sharpness we do not rely on any differential formula the main novelty is a stochastic domination result which is inspired by russo  we also discuss a consequence of our result for percolation in high dimensions where it can be seen as a near critical sharpness estimate\",\"this article presents intertwining relations for infinite particle systems in the continuum motivated by the generalization of stochastic duality the study focuses on a system of sticky brownian motions also known as howitt warren martingale problem and correlated brownian motions and shows that infinite dimensional orthogonal polynomials intertwine the dynamics of infinitely many particles and their particle evolution the proof is based on two assumptions about the model information about the reversible measures for the particle dynamics and consistency the article shows that compatible families according to le jan and raimond  including the two examples mentioned are consistent additionally explicit formulas for the polynomials are used including a new explicit formula for the orthogonal polynomials with respect to the pascal process as an application of the intertwining relations new reversible measures for the infinite particle dynamics are obtained\",\"in this note we are interested in the asymptotics as of the capacity between the origin and the set  where is the boundary of the unit ball of the lattice  the capacity is defined as the minimum of the dirichlet energy with subject to the boundary conditions and on  this variational problem has arisen in particular in the study of large deviations for first passage percolation for  the capacity converges to some positive constant while for the capacity vanishes polynomially fast the present paper deals with the case  for which we prove that the capacity vanishes as with an explicit constant \",\"we address the scaling limits of random curves arising from eg planar lattice models especially in rough domains the well known precompactness conditions of kemppainen and smirnov show that certain crossing probability estimates guarantee the subsequential weak convergence of the random curves in the topology of unparametrized curves as well as in a topology inherited from the unit disc via conformal maps we complement this result by proving that proceeding to weak limit commutes with changing topology ie limits of conformal images are conformal images of limits with minimal boundary regularity assumptions on the domains where the random curves lie such rough boundaries are especially interesting if in the context of multiple random curves a limit candidate is defined in terms of iterated sle type processes with  and one hence needs to study boundary touching curves in domains slit by other random curves\",\"it is not known and even physicists disagree whether first passage percolation fpp on has an upper critical dimension  such that the fluctuation exponent in dimensions  in part to facilitate study of this question we may nonetheless try to understand properties of fpp in such dimensions should they exist in particular how they should differ from  we show that at least one of three fundamental properties of fpp known or believed to hold when must be false if  a particular one of the three is most plausible to fail and we explore the consequences if it is indeed false these consequences support the idea that when  passage times are local in the sense that the passage time from to is primarily determined by the configuration near and  such locality is manifested by certain disc to disc passage times between discs in parallel hyperplanes being typically much faster than the fastest mean passage time between points in the two discs\",\"in this paper we develop a nash moser iteration type reducibility approach to prove the inverse localization for some dimensional discrete almost periodic operators with power law long range hopping we also provide a quantitative lower bound on the regularity of the hopping as an application some results of are generalized to the power law hopping case\",\"we consider the fluctuations of regular functions of a wigner matrix viewed as an entire matrix  going beyond the well studied tracial mode  which is equivalent to the customary linear statistics of eigenvalues we show that is asymptotically normal for any non trivial bounded deterministic matrix  we identify three different and asymptotically independent modes of this fluctuation corresponding to the tracial part the traceless diagonal part and the off diagonal part of in the entire mesoscopic regime where we find that the off diagonal modes fluctuate on a much smaller scale than the tracial mode in addition we determine the fluctuations in the eigenstate thermalisation hypothesis deutsch  ie prove that the eigenfunction overlaps with any deterministic matrix are asymptotically gaussian after a small spectral averaging in particular in the macroscopic regime our result generalises lytova  to complex and to all crossover ensembles in between the main technical inputs are the recent multi resolvent local laws with traceless deterministic matrices from the companion paper cipolloni erdhos schroder \",\"we review some recent progress on applications of cluster expansions we focus on a system of classical particles living in a continuous medium and interacting via a stable and tempered pair potential we review the cluster expansion in both the canonical and the grand canonical ensemble and compute thermodynamic quantities such as the pressure the free energy as well as various correlation functions we derive the equation of state either by performing inversion of the density activity series or directly in the canonical ensemble further applications to the liquid state expansions and the relevant closures are discussed in particular their convergence in the gas regime\",\"we perform a rigorous study of the identical sphere packing problem in and of phase transitions in the corresponding hard core model the sphere diameter and the fugacity are the varying parameters of the model we solve the sphere packing problem for values   for values  and we establish the diagram of periodic pure phases completely or partially for the case  we use results from hales proof of keplers conjecture\",\"modern theories of phase transitions and scale invariance are rooted in path integral formulation and renormalization groups rg despite the applicability of these approaches on simple systems with only pairwise interactions they are less effective on complex systems with un decomposable high order interactions ie interactions among arbitrary sets of units to precisely characterize the universality of high order interacting systems we propose simplex path integral and simplex renormalization group as the generalizations of classic approaches to arbitrary high order and heterogeneous interactions we first formalize the trajectories of units governed by high order interactions to define path integrals on corresponding simplexes based on a multi order propagator then we develop a method to integrate out short range high order interactions in the momentum space accompanied by a coarse graining procedure functioning on the simplex structure generated by high order interactions in a special case where all interactions are decomposable our framework reduces to the well known laplacian rg in more general cases with intertwined high order interactions our theory is validated on large scale data sets of real complex systems eg distributed information processing in the brain to demonstrate its capacity for identifying intrinsic properties of high order interacting systems during system reduction\",\"in this article we prove that there exists a continuous eigenfunction for the transfer operator corresponding to potentials for the classical dyson model in the subcritical regime for which the parameter is greater than  and we conjecture that this value is sharp this is a significant improvement on previous results where the existence of a continuous eigenfunction of the transfer operator was only established for general potentials satisfying summable variations which would correspond to the parameter range  moreover this complements as result by bissacot endo van enter and le ny  who showed that there is no continuous eigenfunction at low temperatures our approach to obtaining these new results involves a novel approach based on random cluster models\",\"random matrices from the elliptic ginibre orthogonal ensemble ginoe are a certain linear combination of a real symmetric and real anti symmetric real gaussian random matrices and controlled by a parameter  our interest is in the fluctuations of the number of real eigenvalues for fixed when the expected number is proportional to the square root of the matrix size  and for scaled to the weakly non symmetric limit when the number of eigenvalues is proportional to  by establishing that the generating function for the probabilities specifying the distribution of the number of real eigenvalues has only negative real zeros and using too the fact that variances in both circumstancesof interest tends to infinity as  the known central limit theorem for the fluctuations is strengthened to a local central limit theorem and the rate of convergence is discussed\",\"we prove the assymptotic equivalence of a sequence of block diagonal matrices with toeplitz blocks the blocks are the principal submatrices of an originating toeplitz sequence with generating symbol of the wiener class as an application using the invariance of certain textitdiagonal and textitcyclic diagonal operator subspaces of the gksl generators of circulant and wclt quantum markov semigroups the asymptotic equivalence of the families is proved under suitable hypothesis\",\"dynamical fluctuations or rare events associated with atypical trajectories in chaotic maps due to specific initial conditions can be very relevant as the may lead to stability islands or regions in phase space with other features of interest yet finding such initial conditions is a daunting task precisely because of the chaotic nature of the system in this work we circumvent this problem by proposing a framework for finding an effective topologically conjugate map whose typical trajectories correspond to atypical ones of the original map this is illustrated by means of examples which focus on counterbalancing the instability of fixed points and periodic orbits as well as on the characterization of a dynamical phase transition involving the finite time lyapunov exponent the procedure parallels that of the application of the generalized doob transform in the stochastic dynamics of markov chains diffusive process and open quantum systems which in each case results in a new process having the prescribed statistics in its stationary state this work thus brings chaotic maps into the increasing family of systems whose rare fluctuations can be characterized and controlled by means of a large deviation formalism\",\"there has been significant interest in studying the asymptotics of certain generalised moments called the moments of moments of characteristic polynomials of random haar distributed unitary and symplectic matrices as the matrix size goes to infinity these quantities depend on two parameters and and when both of them are positive integers it has been shown that these moments are in fact polynomials in the matrix size  in this paper we classify the integer roots of these polynomials and moreover prove that the polynomials themselves satisfy a certain symmetry property this confirms some predictions from the thesis of bailey the proof uses the ehrhart macdonald reciprocity for rational convex polytopes and certain bijections between lattice points in some polytopes\",\"the focus of our paper is to

admits an excursion decomposition similar to the classical excursion decomposition of the brownian motion in particular d continuum gff can be written as an infinite sum of disjoint positive and negative sign excursions which are given by minkowski content measures of clusters of a critical d brownian loop soup with iid signs although the d continuum gff is not even a signed measure we show that the decomposition to positive and negative parts is unique under natural conditions\",\"we consider the macroscopic limit for the space time density fluctuations in the open symmetric simple exclusion in the quasi static scaling limit we prove that the distribution of these fluctuations converge to a gaussian space time field that is delta correlated in time but with long range

decaying case were studied before in  in this paper we consider more general decaying profiles that lie in between these two extreme cases we characterize the scaling limit of transfer matrices and determine the point process limit of eigenvalues near a fixed energy in the bulk in terms of solutions to coupled sdes we obtain new point processes that share similar properties to the process we determine the shape profile of eigenfunctions after a suitable re scaling that correspond to a uniformly chosen eigenvalue of  we also give more description of the new point processes we just defined

cards a natural generalization of the celebrated random adjacent transposition shuffle in the shuffle we choose uniformly at random a block of consecutive cards and shuffle these cards according to a permutation chosen uniformly at random from the symmetric group on elements we study the total variation mixing time of the shuffle when the number of cards goes to infinity allowing also to grow with

logarithmic energy as a candidate starting configuration for this problem armentano beltran and shub considered the set of points given by the stereographic projection of the roots of the random elliptic polynomial of degree and computed the expected logarithmic energy we study the fluctuations of the logarithmic energy associated to this random configuration and prove a central limit theorem

continuously under environmental interactions quantum markov semigroups model such processes in dissipative environments it is known that a finite dimensional quantum markov semigroup with detailed balance induces exponential decay toward a subspace of invariant or fully decayed states in contrast we analyze continuous processes that combine coherent and stochastic processes precluding detailed balance first we find counterexamples to analogous decay bounds for these processes and prove conditions under which they fail second we prove that the relationship between the strength of local noise applied to part of a larger system and overall decay of the whole is non monotonic noise can suppress interactions that would spread it faster decay of a subsystem may thereby slow overall decay we observe this interplay numerically and its discrete analog experimentally on ibm q systems our main results explain and generalize the phenomenon theoretically finally we observe that in spite of its absence at early times exponential decay re appears for unital finite dimensional semigroups at finite time\",\"we investigate the thermodynamic limit of the circular long range riesz gas a system of particles interacting pairwise through an inverse power kernel we show that after rescaling so that the typical spacing of particles is of order  the microscopic point process converges as the number of points tends to infinity to an infinite volume measure  this convergence result is obtained by analyzing gaps correlations which are shown to decay in power law with exponent  our method is based on the analysis of the helffer sjostrand equation in its static form and on various discrete elliptic regularity estimates\",\"we study the langevin dynamics for spherical spin models focusing on the short time regime described by the cugliandolo kurchan equations confirming a conjecture of biroli we show the asymptotic energy achieved is exactly in the low temperature limit the upper bound uses hardness results for lipschitz optimization algorithms and applies for all temperatures for the lower bound we prove the dynamics reaches and stays above the lowest energy of any approximate local maximum in fact the latter behavior holds for any hamiltonian obeying natural smoothness estimates even with disorder dependent initialization and on exponential time scales\",\"we present the conditional determinantal point process dpp approach to obtain new mostly fredholm determinantal expressions for various eigenvalue statistics in random matrix theory it is well known that many especially  eigenvalue point correlation functions are given in terms of determinants ie they are continuous dpps we exploit a derived kernel of the conditional dpp which gives the point correlation function conditioned on the event of some eigenvalues already existing at fixed locations using such kernels we obtain new determinantal expressions for the joint densities of the largest eigenvalues probability density functions of the largest eigenvalue density of the first eigenvalue spacing and more our formulae are highly amenable to numerical computations and we provide various numerical experiments several numerical values that required hours of computing time could now be computed in seconds with our expressions which proves the effectiveness of our approach we also demonstrate that our technique can be applied to an efficient sampling of dr paths of the aztec diamond domino tiling further extending the conditional dpp sampling technique we sample airy processes from the extended airy kernel additionally we propose a sampling method for non hermitian projection dpps\",\"we show that classical integrable models of last passage percolation and the related nonintersecting random walks converge uniformly on compact sets to the airy line ensemble our core approach is to show convergence of nonintersecting bernoulli random walks in all feasible directions in the parameter space

the matrix increases under the insertion of a point charge we derive the scaling limit at the singular boundary point which is expressed in terms of the solution to the model painleve iv riemann hilbert problem for this we introduce a version of the christoffel darboux identity and combine it with the strong asymptotics of the associated orthogonal polynomials due to bertola elias rebelo and grava\",\"we prove eigenvalue processes from dynamical random matrix theory including dyson brownian motion wishart process and dynkins brownian motion of ellipsoids are results of projecting brownian motion through riemannian submersions induced by isometric action of compact lie groups whose orbits have nonzero mean curvature which contributes to drift terms and is the log gradient of orbit volume indicating that eigenvalues collide exactly when the orbit is degenerate we are thus able to provide a unified treatment and better connection between eigenvalue processes in different settings with the language of riemannian geometry under such interpretation we see how we can naturally recover eigenvector processes and derive process such as dyson brownian motion for general \",\"we study the statistics of hamiltonian cycles on various families of bicolored random planar maps with the spherical topology these families fall into two groups corresponding to two distinct universality classes with respective central charges and  the first group includes generic regular maps with vertices of fixed valency  whereas the second group comprises maps with vertices of mixed valencies and the so called rigid case of regular maps  for which at each vertex the unvisited edges are equally distributed on both sides of the cycle we predict for each class its universal configuration exponent  as well as a new universal critical exponent characterizing the number of long distance contacts along the hamiltonian cycle these exponents are theoretically obtained by using the knizhnik polyakov and zamolodchikov kpz relations with the appropriate values of the central charge applied in the case of  to the corresponding critical exponent on regular hexagonal or square lattices these predictions are numerically confirmed by analyzing exact enumeration results for regular maps with  and for maps with mixed valencies  and \",\"markov random fields on a countable set are studied they

an asymptotic shape for large partitions under the plancherel measure we prove that when we consider regularisations of such partitions we still have a limit shape which is given by a shaking of the kerov vershik logan shepp curve we deduce an explicit form for the first asymptotics of the length of the first rows and the first columns for the regularisation\",\"consider a random symmetric matrix with iidentries on and above its diagonal that are products of bernoulli random variables and random variables with sub gaussian tails such a matrix will be called a sparse wigner matrix and can be viewed as the adjacency matrix of a random network with sub gaussian weights on its edges in the regime where the mean degree is at least logarithmic in dimension the edge eigenvalues of an appropriately scaled sparse wigner matrix stick to the edges of the support of the semicircle law we show that in this sparsity regime the large deviations upper tail event of the largest eigenvalue of a sparse wigner matrix with sub gaussian entries is generated by either the emergence of a high degree vertex with a large vertex weight or that of a clique with large edge weights interestingly the rate function obtained is discontinuous at the typical value of the largest eigenvalue which accounts for the fact that its large deviation behaviour is generated by finite rank perturbations this complements the results of ganguly and nam and ganguly hiesmayr and nam which considered the case where the mean degree is constant\",\"we study the integrated density of states ids of the random schrodinger operator appearing in the study of certain reinforced random processes in connection with a supersymmetric sigma model we rely on previous results on the supersymmetric sigma model to obtain lower and upper bounds on the asymptotic behavior of the ids near the bottom of the spectrum in all dimension we show a phase transition for the ids between weak and strong disorder regime in dimension larger or equal to three that follows from a phase transition in the corresponding random process and supersymmetric sigma model in particular we show that the ids does not exhibit lifshitz tails in the strong disorder regime confirming a recent conjecture this is in stark contrast with other disordered systems like the anderson model a wegner type estimate is also derived giving an upper bound on the ids and showing the regularity of the function\",\"let be the adjacency matrix of the erdhos renyi directed graph  we denote the eigenvalues of by  and  for  we show that  maxin

as a by product we also show that all non trivial eigenvectors of are completely delocalized for hermitian random matrices it is known that the edge statistics are sensitive to the sparsity in the very sparse regime one needs to remove many noise random variables which affect both the mean and the fluctuation to recover the tracy widom distribution our results imply that compared to their analogues in the hermitian case the edge statistics of non hermitian sparse random matrices are more robust\",\"we study the hard core model of statistical mechanics on a unit cubic lattice  which is intrinsically related to the sphere packing problem for spheres with centers in  the model is defined by the sphere diameter which is interpreted as a euclidean exclusion distance between point particles located at spheres centers the second parameter of the underlying model is the particle fugacity  for the ground states of the model are given by the dense packings of the spheres the identification of such dense packings is a considerable challenge and we solve it for as well as for  where  for the former family of values of our proofs are self contained for our results are based

high density regime  where the system is ordered and tends to fluctuate around some ground states in particular for only a finite number out of countably many layered periodic ground states generate pure phases\",\"synchronization phenomena on networks have attracted much attention in studies of neural social economic and biological systems yet we still lack a systematic understanding of how relative synchronizability relates to underlying network structure indeed this question is of central importance to the key theme of how dynamics on networks relate to their structure more generally we present an analytic technique to directly measure the relative synchronizability of noise driven time series processes on networks in terms of the directed network structure we consider both discrete time auto regressive processes and continuous time ornstein uhlenbeck dynamics on networks our technique builds on computation of the network covariance matrix in the space orthogonal to the synchronized state enabling it to be more general than previous work in not requiring either symmetric undirected or diagonalizable connectivity matrices and allowing arbitrary self link weights more importantly our approach quantifies the relative synchronisation specifically in terms of the contribution of process motif walk structures we demonstrate that in general the relative abundance of process motifs with convergent directed walks including feedback and feedforward loops hinders synchronizability we also reveal subtle differences between the motifs involved for discrete or continuous time dynamics our insights analytically explain several known general results regarding synchronizability of networks including that small world and regular networks are less synchronizable than random networks\",\"the lorentz gas describes an ensemble of noninteracting point particles in an infinite array of spherical scatterers in the present paper we consider the case when the scatterer configuration p is a fixed union of translated lattices in rd and prove that in the limit of low scatterer density the particle dynamics converges to a random flight process in the special case when the lattices in p are pairwise incommensurable this settles a conjecture from  the proof is carried out by applying a framework developed in recent work by marklof and strombergsson  and central parts of our proof are the construction of an admissible marking of the point set p and the verification of the uniform spherical equidistribution condition required in  regarding the random flight process obtained in the low density limit of the lorentz gas we prove that it can be reconstructed from the corresponding limiting flight processes arising from the individual commensurability classes of lattices in p we furthermore prove that the free path lengths of the limit flight process have a distribution with a power law tail whose exponent depends on the number of commensurability classes in p\",\"we study the eigenvector mass distribution for generalized wigner matrices on a set of coordinates  where  and prove it converges to a gaussian at every energy level including the edge as  the key technical input is a four point decorrelation estimate for eigenvectors of matrices with a large gaussian component its proof is an application of the maximum principle to a new set of moment observables satisfying parabolic evolution equations additionally we prove high probability quantum unique ergodicity and quantum weak mixing bounds for all eigenvectors and all deterministic sets of entries using a novel bootstrap argument\",\"the randomized quantum marginal problem asks about the joint distribution of the partial traces marginals of a uniform random hermitian operator with fixed spectrum acting on a space of tensors we introduce a new approach to this problem based on studying the mixed moments of the entries of the marginals for randomized quantum marginal problems that describe systems of distinguishable particles bosons or fermions we prove formulae for these mixed moments which determine the joint distribution of the marginals completely our main tool is weingarten calculus which provides a method for computing integrals of polynomial functions with respect to haar measure on the unitary group as an application in the case of two distinguishable particles we prove some results on the asymptotic behavior of the marginals as the dimension of one or both hilbert spaces goes to infinity\",\"we study a diluted mean field spin glass model with a quadratic hamiltonian our main result establishes the limiting free energy in terms of an integral of a family of random variables that are the weak limits of the quenched variances of the spins in the system with varying edge connectivity the key ingredient in our argument is played by the identification of these random variables as the unique solution to a recursive distributional equation our results in particular provide the first example of the diluted shcherbina tirozzi model whose limiting free energy can be derived at any inverse temperature and external field\",\"we consider a stochastic process of heat conduction where energy is redistributed along a chain between nearest neighbor sites via an improper beta distribution similar to the well known kipnis marchioro presutti kmp model the finite chain is coupled at its ends with two reservoirs that break the conservation of energy when working at different temperatures at variance with kmp the model considered here is integrable and one can write in a closed form the point correlation functions of the non equilibrium steady state as a consequence of the exact solution one can directly prove that the system is in a local equilibrium and described at the macro scale by a product measure integrability manifests itself through the description of the model via the open heisenberg chain with non compact spins the algebraic formulation of the model allows to interpret its duality relation with a purely absorbing particle system as a change of representation\",\"we study gibbs measures with log correlated base gaussian fields on the dimensional torus in the defocusing case the construction of such gibbs measures follows from nelsons argument in this paper we consider the focusing case with a quartic interaction using the variational formulation we prove non normalizability of the gibbs measure when  our argument provides an alternative proof of the non normalizability result for the focusing measure by brydges and slade  furthermore we provide a precise rate of divergence where the constant is characterized by the optimal constant for a certain bernsteins inequality on  we also go over the construction of the focusing gibbs measure with a cubic interaction in the appendices we present a non normalizability of the gibbs measure for the two dimensional zakharov system and b the construction of focusing quartic gibbs measures with smoother base gaussian measures showing a critical nature of the log correlated gibbs measure with a focusing quartic interaction\",\"we prove asymptotics for real moments of the logarithmic derivative of characteristic polynomials evaluated at in unitary even orthogonal and symplectic ensembles where and as the size of the matrix goes to infinity previously such asymptotics were known only for integer moments in the unitary ensemble by the work of bailey bettin blower conrey prokhorov rubinstein and snaith and in orthogonal and symplectic ensembles by the work of alvarez and snaith except that in the odd orthogonal ensemble real moments asymptotics were obtained by alvarez bousseyroux and snaith our proof is new and does not make use of the aforementioned integer moments results and is different from the method in the work of alvarez et al for the odd orthogonal ensemble\",\"we provide a perfect sampling algorithm for the hard sphere model on subsets of with expected running time linear in the volume under the assumption of strong spatial mixing a large number of perfect and approximate sampling algorithms have been devised to sample from the hard sphere model and our perfect sampling algorithm is efficient for a range of parameters for which only efficient approximate samplers were previously known and is faster than these known approximate approaches our methods also extend to the more general setting of gibbs point processes interacting via finite range repulsive potentials\",\"suppose that is compact and symmetric about the real axis and is a finite union of rectangles and real intervals with transfinite diameter  suppose that is a holder arithmetic probability distribution on defined in with

eigenvalue angles in small intervals\",\"height functions are random functions on a given graph in our case integer valued functions on the two dimensional square lattice we consider gradient potentials which informally lie between the discrete gaussian and solid on solid model inclusive the phase transition in this model known as the roughening transition berezinskii kosterlitz thouless transition or localisation delocalisation transition was established rigorously in the breakthrough work of frohlich and spencer it was not until that sheffield derived continuity of the phase transition first we establish sharpness in the sense that covariances decay exponentially in the localised phase second we show that the model is delocalised at criticality in the sense that the set of potentials inducing localisation is open in a natural topology third we prove that the pointwise variance of the height function is at least in the delocalised regime where is the distance to the boundary and where denotes a universal constant this implies that the effective temperature of any potential cannot lie in the interval whenever it is well defined and jumps from to at least at the critical point we call this range of forbidden values the effective temperature gap\",\"we consider large non hermitian matrices with an additive independent identically distributed iid noise for each matrix elements we show that already a small noise of variance completely thermalises the bulk singular vectors in particular they satisfy the strong form of quantum unique ergodicity que with an optimal speed of convergence in physics terms we thus extend the eigenstate thermalisation hypothesis formulated originally by deutsch  and proven for wigner matrices in cipolloni erdhos schroder  to arbitrary non hermitian matrices with an iid noise as a consequence we obtain an optimal lower bound on the diagonal overlaps of the corresponding non hermitian eigenvectors this quantity also known as the square of the eigenvalue condition number measuring the sensitivity of the eigenvalue to small perturbations has notoriously escaped rigorous treatment beyond the explicitly computable ginibre ensemble apart from the very recent upper bounds given in arxiv and arxiv as a key tool we develop a new systematic decomposition of general observables in random matrix theory that governs the size of products of resolvents with deterministic matrices in between\",\"we study additive finite rank perturbations of random periodic band matrices under the assumption that the nontrivial eigenvalues of the perturbation do not depend on the dimension we establish the eigenvalueeigenvector bbp transition in this model for band widths  our analysis relies on moment method calculations for general vector states\",\"we establish new characterizations of amenability of graphs through two probabilistic notions stochastic domination and finitary codings also called finitary factors on the stochastic domination side we show that the plus state of the ising model at very low temperature stochastically dominates a high density bernoulli percolation if and only if the underlying graph is nonamenable this answers a question of liggett and steif we prove a similar result for the infinite cluster process of bernoulli percolation which is of particular interest as this process is not monotone and does not possess any nice form of the domain markov property we also prove that the plus states of the ising model at very low temperatures are stochastically ordered if and only if the graph is nonamenable this answers a second question of liggett and steif we further show that these stochastic domination results can be witnessed by invariant monotone couplings on the finitary coding side we show that the plus state of the ising model at very low temperature is a finitary factor of an iid process if and only if the underlying graph is nonamenable assuming it supports a phase transition we show a similar result for the infinite cluster process of a high density bernoulli percolation a main technique is to consider diluted processes for which holleys condition can be established in order to compare two ising models we apply a dilution mechanism using lattice gas theory along the way we develop general tools to establish invariant domination when holleys condition is satisfied the finitary factor results are based on the stochastic domination results and a dynamical construction involving bounding chains along with a new technique to analyze coupling from the past in infinite range processes via a novel disease spreading model which may be of independent interest\",\"the solid on solid model is a model of height functions introduced to study the interface separating the and phase in the ising model the planar solid on solid model thus corresponds to the three dimensional ising model delocalisation of this model at high temperature and at zero slope was first derived by frohlich and spencer in parallel to proving the berezinskii kosterlitz thouless phase transition the first main result of this article consists of a simple alternative proof of delocalisation of the solid on solid model in fact the argument is more general it works on any planar graph not just the square lattice and implies that the interface delocalises at any slope rather than exclusively at the zero slope the second main result proved independently is that the absolute value of the height function in this model satisfies the fkg lattice condition this property is believed to be intimately linked to the quantitative understanding of delocalisation given the recent successes in the context of the square ice and more generally the six vertex model and it has already been used elsewhere in a new proof of the bkt transition the new fkg inequality is shown to hold true for both the solid on solid model as well as for the discrete gaussian model which in this article implies that the two notions of delocalisation namely delocalisation in finite volume and delocalisation of shift invariant gibbs measures coincide\",\"we consider two ensembles of nxn matrices the first is the set of all nxn matrices with entries zeroes and ones such that all column sums and all row sums equal r uniformly weighted the second is the set of nxn matrices with zero and one entries where the probability that any given entry is one is rn the probabilities of the set of individual entries being iids calling the two expectation values e and eb respectively we develop a formal relation eperma  ebperm a x expsum ti we also use a well known approximating ensemble to e e we prove using e or e one obtains the same value of ti for i   the published version of this paper only obtains results for i   we go beyond the results of the published version by taking much more advantage of recent work of pernici and of wanless on i matchings on regular bipartite graphsthese terms ti i   have amazing properties we conjecture that these properties hold also for all i\",\"we consider the determinantal point processes associated with the spectral projectors of a schrodinger operator on  with a smooth confining potential in the semiclassical limit where the number of particles tends to infinity we obtain a szegho type central limit theorem clt for the fluctuations of smooth linear statistics more precisely the laplace transform of any statistic converges without renormalization to a gaussian limit with a type variance which depends on the potential in the one well one cut case using the quantum action angle theorem and additional micro local tools we reduce the problem to the asymptotics of fredholm determinants of certain approximately toeplitz operators in the multi cut case we show that for generic potentials a similar result holds and the contributions of each wells are independent in the limit\",\"we consider the statistics of the extreme eigenvalues of sparse random matrices a class of random matrices that includes the normalized adjacency matrices of the erdh os renyi graph  recently it was shown by lee up to an explicit random shift the optimal rigidity of extreme eigenvalues holds provided the averaged degree grows with the size of the graph  we prove in the same regime i optimal rigidity holds for all eigenvalues with respect to an explicit random measure ii up to an explicit random shift the fluctuations of the extreme eigenvalues are given the tracy widom distribution\",\"we study fluctuations of the current at the boundary for the half space asymmetric simple exclusion process asep and the height function of the half space six vertex model at the boundary at large times we establish a phase transition depending on the asymptotic density of particles at the boundary with gse and goe limits as well as the baik rains crossover distribution near the critical point this was previously known for half space last passage percolation and recently established for the half space log gamma polymer and kpz equation in the groundbreaking work of imamura mucciconi and sasamoto the proof uses the underlying algebraic structure of these models in a crucial way to obtain exact formulas in particular we show a relationship between the half space six vertex model and a half space hall littlewood measure with two boundary parameters which is then matched to a free boundary schur process via a new identity of symmetric functions fredholm pfaffian formulas are established for the half space asep and six vertex model indicating a hidden free fermionic structure\",\"we give an interpretation of a class of discrete to continuum results for ising systems using the theory of zonoids we define the classes of rational zonotopes and zonoids as those of the wulff shapes of perimeters obtained as limits of finite range homogeneous ising systems and of general homogeneous ising systems respectively thanks to the characterization of zonoids in terms of measures on the sphere rational zonotopes identified as finite sums of dirac masses are dense in the class of all zonoids moreover we show that a rational zonoid can be obtained from a coercive ising system if and only if the corresponding measure satisfies some connectedness properties while it is always a continuum limit of discrete wulff shapes under the only condition that the support of the measure spans the whole space finally we highlight the connection with the homogenization of periodic ising systems and propose a generalized definition of rational zonotope of order n which coincides with the definition of rational zonotope if n\",\"in  cohn kenyon and propp studied uniformly random perfect matchings of large induced subgraphs of aka dimer configurations or domino tilings and developed a large deviation theory for the associated height functions we establish similar results for large induced subgraphs of  to formulate these results recall that a perfect matching on a bipartite graph induces a flow that sends one unit of current from each even vertex to its odd partner one can then subtract a reference flow to obtain a divergence free flow we show that the flow induced by a uniformly random dimer configuration converges in law when boundary conditions on a bounded are controlled and the mesh size tends to zero to the deterministic divergence free flow on that maximizes given the boundary data where is the maximal specific entropy obtained by an ergodic gibbs measure with mean current  the function is not known explicitly but we prove that it is continuous and em strictly concave on the octahedron of possible mean currents except on the edges of  which implies under reasonable boundary conditions that the maximizer is uniquely determined we further establish two versions of a large deviation principle using the integral above to quantify how exponentially unlikely the discrete random flows are to approximate other deterministic flows the planar dimer model is mathematically rich and well studied but many of the most powerful tools do not seem readily adaptable to higher dimensions our analysis begins with a smaller set of tools which include halls matching theorem the ergodic theorem non intersecting lattice path formulations and double dimer cycle swaps\",\"aesops famous fable the ant and the grasshopper emphasizes the choice that living beings have to make between survival the ant and reproduction the grasshopper apis mellifera colonies face the same dilemma  must they rather collect nectar in order to produce honey that will enable them to endure the cold of winter or should they choose to bring pollen back to the hive so as to raise young bees  both of course but in which proportion  and where should they fly to find the best resources  we adress these question through a mathematical perspective by considering the geometry of resources around the hive\",\"in this paper we review results of anderson localization for different random families of operators which enter in the framework of random quasi one dimensional models we first recall what is anderson localization from both physical and mathematical point of views from the anderson bernoulli conjecture in dimension we justify the introduction of quasi one dimensional models then we present different types of these models  the schrodinger type in the discrete and continuous cases the unitary type the dirac type and the point interactions type in a second part we present tools coming from the study of dynamical systems in dimension one  the transfer matrices formalism the lyapunov exponents and the furstenberg group we then prove a criterion of localization for quasi one dimensional models of schrodinger type involving only geometric and algebraic properties of the furstenberg group then in the last two sections we review results of localization first for schrodinger type models and then for unitary type models each time we reduce the question of localization to the study of the furstenberg group and show how to use more and more refined algebraic criterions to prove the needed properties of this group all the presented results for quasi one dimensional models of schrodinger type include the case of bernoulli randomness\",\"the branching rule is one of the most fundamental properties of the macdonald symmetric polynomials it expresses a macdonald polynomial as a nonnegative linear combination of macdonald polynomials with smaller number of variables taking a limit of the branching rule under the principal specialization when the number of variables goes to infinity we obtain a markov chain of noncolliding particles with negative drift and an absorbing wall at zero the chain depends on the macdonald parameters and may be viewed as a discrete deformation of the dyson brownian motion the trajectory of the markov chain is equivalent to a certain gibbs ensemble of plane partitions with an arbitrary cascade front wall in the jack limit the absorbing wall disappears and the macdonald noncolliding walks turn into the noncolliding random walks studied by huang int math res not   arxiv taking hall littlewood degeneration and further sending  we obtain a continuous time particle system on with inhomogeneous jump rates and absorbing wall at zero\",\"we calculate the average number of critical points of the energy landscape of a many body system with disordered two body interactions and a weak on site potential we find that introducing a weak nonlinear on site potential dramatically increases to exponential in system size and give a complete picture of the organization of critical points our results extend solvable spin glass models to physically more realistic models and are of relevance to glassy systems nonlinear oscillator networks and many body interacting systems\",\"we study real eigenvalues of real elliptic ginibre matrices indexed by a non hermiticity parameter  in both the strong and weak non hermiticity regime here is assumed to be an even number in both regimes we prove a central limit theorem for the number of real eigenvalues we also find the asymptotic behaviour of the probability that exactly eigenvalues are real in the strong non hermiticity regime where is fixed we find beginalign limntoinfty fracsqrtn log pnkntau

fracn log pnkntau leq fracpi int logleft e alpha sright sqrt s  ds endalign for any sequence of even numbers such that as  this inequality is expected to be an equality\",\"we investigate circuit complexity of unitaries generated by time evolution of randomly chosen strongly interacting hamiltonians in finite dimensional hilbert spaces specifically we focus on two ensembles of random generators the so called gaussian unitary ensemble gue and the ensemble of diagonal gaussian matrices conjugated by haar random unitary transformations in both scenarios we prove that the complexity of exhibits a surprising behaviour with high probability it reaches the maximal allowed value on the same time scale as needed to escape the neighborhood of the identity consisting of unitaries with trivial zero complexity we furthermore observe similar behaviour for quantum states originating from time evolutions generated by above ensembles and for diagonal unitaries generated from the ensemble of diagonal gaussian hamiltonians to establish these results we rely heavily on structural properties of the above ensembles such as unitary invariance and concentration of measure techniques this gives us a much finer control over the time evolution of complexity compared to techniques previously employed in this context high degree moments and frame potentials\",\"we use non symmetric cauchy kernel identities to get the law of last passagepercolation models in terms of demazure characters the construction is basedon some restrictions of the rsk correspondence that we rephrase in a unifiedway which is compatible with crystal basis theory\",\"we show that the symmetric simple exclusion process ssep on an countable set is well defined by the stirring graphical construction as soon as the dynamics of a single particle is the resulting process is feller its markov generator is derived on local functions duality at the level of the empirical density field holds we then move to the simple exclusion process sep and show that the graphical construction leads to a well defined feller process under a percolation type assumption corresponding to subcriticality in a percolation with random parameters we derive its markov generator on local functions we discuss applications of the above results to sseps and seps in random environments where the standard assumptions to construct the process and investigate its basic properties by the analytic approach or by graphical constructions are typically violated as detailed in  our results for ssep also allow to extend the quenched hydrodynamic limit in path space obtained in  by removing assumption sep used in there\",\"we consider the iid bernoulli field with occupation density on a possibly non regular countably infinite tree with bounded degrees for large  we show that the quasilocal gibbs property ie compatibility with a suitable quasilocal specification is lost under the deterministic transformation which removes all isolated ones and replaces them by zeros while a quasilocal specification does exist at small  our results provide an example for an independent field in a spatially non homogeneous setup which loses the quasilocal gibbs property under a local deterministic transformation\",\"in this paper we study two loop contribution to the effective action of a two dimensional sigma model we derive a new formula which can be applicable to a regularization of general type as examples we obtain known results for dimensional regularization and investigate new types of cutoff one also we discuss non local contributions and restrictions on the regularization\",\"we consider random walks in a uniformly elliptic balanced iid random environment in the integer lattice for and the corresponding problem of stochastic homogenization of non divergence form difference operators we first derive a quantitative law of large numbers for the invariant measure which is nearly optimal a mixing property of the field of the invariant measure is then achieved we next obtain rates of convergence for the homogenization of the dirichlet problem for non divergence form operators which are generically optimal for and nearly optimal when  furthermore we establish the existence stationarity and uniqueness properties of the corrector problem for all dimensions  afterwards we quantify the ergodicity of the environmental process for both the continuous time and discrete time random walks and as a consequence we get explicit convergence rates for the quenched central limit theorem of the balanced random walk\",\"we consider the classical xy model or classical rotor model on the two dimensional square lattice graph as well as its dual model which is a model of height functions the xy model has a phase transition called the berezinskii kosterlitz thouless transition there is a heuristic which predicts that this phase transition should coincide with the localisation delocalisation transition for height functions the primal and dual model share the same partition function and the phase transition of either model should coincide with the unique non analytic point of the partition function when expressed in terms of the inverse temperature we use probabilistic arguments to prove that the correlation length the reciprocal of the mass of the xy model is exactly twice the correlation length of the height function which implies in particular that the prediction of this heuristic is correct namely that the bkt phase for the xy model coincides exactly with the delocalised phase of the dual height function\",\"this paper is a short note in which we use the techniques from arxiv to give a short proof of the capacity estimate in metastability for arbitrary configurations\",\"in bain j math phys   we found asymptotics of one point correlation functions of the two periodic weighted aztec diamond in the mesoscopic limit where the linear size of the ordered region is of the same order as the correlation length in this paper we follow up with a numerical study of two point correlation functions of dimers separated by a mesoscopic distance\",\"a variety of transport processes in natural and man made systems are intrinsically random to model their stochasticity lattice random walks have been employed for a long time mainly by considering cartesian lattices however in many applications in bounded space the geometry of the domain may have profound effects on the dynamics and ought to be accounted for we consider here the cases of the six neighbour hexagonal and three neighbour honeycomb lattice which are utilised in models ranging from adatoms diffusing in metals and excitations diffusing on single walled carbon nanotubes to animal foraging strategy and the formation of territories in scent marking organisms in these and other examples the main theoretical tool to study the dynamics of lattice random walks in hexagonal geometries has been via simulations analytic representations have in most cases been inaccessible in particular in bounded hexagons given the complicated zig zag boundary conditions that a walker is subject to here we generalise the method of images to hexagonal geometries and obtain closed form expressions for the occupation probability the so called propagator for lattice random walks both on hexagonal and honeycomb lattices with periodic reflective and absorbing boundary conditions in the periodic case we identify two possible choices of image placement and their corresponding propagators using them we construct the exact propagators for the other boundary conditions and we derive transport related statistical quantities such as first passage probabilities to one or multiple targets and their means elucidating the effect of the boundary condition on transport properties\",\"we show that the vertex reinforced jump process on the d dimensional lattice with long range jumps is transient as long as the initial weights do not decay too fast the main ingredients in the proof are the relation of the corresponding random environment on finite boxes with a non linear supersymmetric hyperbolic sigma model a comparison with a hierarchical model and the translation of the hierarchical model to a non homogeneous effective one dimensional model\",\"when can we uniquely map the dynamic evolution of a classical density to a time dependent potential in equilibrium without time dependence the one body density uniquely specifies the external potential that is applied to the system this mapping from a density to the potential is the cornerstone of classical density functional theory dft here we derive rigorous and explicit conditions for such a unique mapping between a nonequilibrium density profile and a time dependent external potential we thus prove the underlying assertion of dynamical density functional theory ddft with or without the so called adiabatic approximation often used in applications we also illustrate loopholes when our conditions are violated so that two distinct external potentials result in the same density profiles but different currents as suggested by the framework of power functional theory pft\",\"we consider a discrete time tasep where each particle jumps according to bernoulli random variables with particle dependent and time inhomogeneous parameters we use the combinatorics of the robinson schensted knuth correspondence and certain intertwining relations to express the transition kernel of this interacting particle system in terms of ensembles of weighted non intersecting lattice paths and consequently as a marginal of a determinantal point process we next express the joint distribution of the particle positions as a fredholm determinant whose correlation kernel is given in terms of a boundary value problem for a discrete heat equation the solution to such a problem finally leads us to a representation of the correlation kernel in terms of random walk hitting probabilities generalising the formulation of matetski quastel and remenik acta math  to the case of both particle and time inhomogeneous rates the solution to the boundary value problem in the fully inhomogeneous case appears with a finer structure than in the homogeneous case\",\"let be an truncation of an haar distributed unitary matrix we consider the disk counting statistics of the eigenvalues of  we prove that as with fixed the associated moment generating function enjoys asymptotics of the form beginalign exp big c n  c  o big endalign where the constants and are given in terms of the incomplete gamma function our proof uses the uniform asymptotics of the incomplete beta function\",\"sampling from the state ferromagnetic potts model is a fundamental question in statistical physics probability theory and theoretical computer science on general graphs this problem is computationally hard and this hardness holds at arbitrarily low temperatures at the same time in recent years there has been significant progress showing the existence of low temperature sampling algorithms in various specific families of graphs our aim in this paper is to understand the minimal structural properties of general graphs that enable polynomial time sampling from the state ferromagnetic potts model at low temperatures we study this problem from the perspective of the widely used swendsen wang dynamics and the closely related random cluster dynamics our results demonstrate that the key graph property behind fast or slow convergence time for these dynamics is whether the independent edge percolation on the graph admits a strongly supercritical phase by this we mean that at large  it has a unique giant component of linear size and the complement of that giant component is comprised of only small components specifically we prove that such a condition implies fast mixing of the swendsen wang and random cluster dynamics on two general families of bounded degree graphs a graphs of at most stretched exponential volume growth and b locally treelike graphs in the other direction we show that even among graphs in those families these markov chains can converge exponentially slowly at arbitrarily low temperatures if the edge percolation condition does not hold in the process we develop new tools for the analysis of non local markov chains including a framework to bound the speed of disagreement propagation in the presence of long range correlations and an understanding of spatial mixing properties on trees with random boundary conditions\",\"for quadratic like maps we show a phenomenon of sensitive dependence of geometric gibbs states there are analytic families of quadratic like maps for which an arbitrarily small perturbation of the parameter can have a definite effect on the low temperature geometric gibbs states furthermore this phenomenon is robust there is an open set of analytic parameter families of quadratic like maps that exhibit sensitive dependence of geometric gibbs states we introduce a geometric version of the peierls condition for contour models ensuring that the low temperature geometric gibbs states are concentrated near the critical orbit\",\"a previous paper by the authors found explicit contour integral formulas for certain joint moments of the multi species q tazrp totally asymmetric zero range process using algebraic methods these contour integral formulas have a pseudo factorized form which makes asymptotic analysis simpler in this brief note we use those contour integral formulas to find the asymptotics of the two point correlations as expected the term arising from the shift invariance makes a non trivial asymptotic contribution\",\"many integrable stochastic particle systems in one space dimension such as tasep totally asymmetric simple exclusion process and its deformation the tasep remain integrable if we equip each particle with its own speed parameter in this work we present intertwining relations between markov transition operators of particle systems which differ by a permutation of the speed parameters these relations generalize our previous works arxiv arxiv but here we employ a novel approach based on the yang baxter equation for the higher spin stochastic six vertex model our intertwiners are markov transition operators which leads to interesting probabilistic consequences first we obtain a new lax type differential equation for the markov transition semigroups of homogeneous continuous time versions of our particle systems our lax equation encodes the time evolution of multipoint observables of the tasep and tasep in a unified way which may be of interest for the asymptotic analysis of multipoint observables of these systems second we show that our intertwining relations lead to couplings between probability measures on trajectories of particle systems which differ by a permutation of the speed parameters the conditional distribution for such a coupling is realized as a rewriting history random walk which randomly resamples the trajectory of a particle in a chamber determined by the trajectories of the neighboring particles as a byproduct we construct a new coupling for standard poisson processes on the positive real half line with different rates\",\"focusing on a continuous time quantum walk on  we analyze a probability distribution with which the quantum walker is observed at a position the walker launches off at a localized state and its system is operated by a spatially periodic hamiltonian as a result we see an asymmetry probability distribution to catch a long time behavior we also try to find a long time limit theorem and realize that the limit distribution holds a symmetry density function\",\"we study scaling limits of exploding abelian sandpiles using ideas from percolation and front propagation in random media we establish sufficient conditions under which a limit shape exists and show via a family of counterexamples that convergence may not occur in general a corollary of our proof is a simple criteria for determining if a sandpile is explosive this strengthens a result of fey levine and peres \",\"we consider the dyson ferrari spohn diffusion  consisting of non intersecting ferrari spohn diffusions on  this object was introduced by ioffe velenik and wachtel  as a scaling limit for line ensembles of non intersecting random walks above a hard wall with area tilts which model certain three dimensional interfaces in statistical physics it was shown by ferrari and shlosman  that as  after a spatial shift of order and constant rescaling in time the top curve converges to the process in the sense of finite dimensional distributions we extend this result by showing that the full ensemble converges with the same shift and time scaling to the airy line ensemble in the topology of uniform convergence on compact sets in our argument we formulate a brownian gibbs property with area tilts for  which we show is equivalent after a global parabolic shift to the usual brownian gibbs property introduced by corwin and hammond \",\"we propose and discuss two variants of kinetic particle models cellular automata in  dimensions which have some appeal due to their simplicity and intriguing properties which could warrant further research and applications the first model is a deterministic and reversible automaton describing two species of quasiparticles stable massless matter particles moving with velocity and unstable standing zero velocity field particles we discuss two distinct continuity equations for three conserved charges of the model while the first two charges and the corresponding currents have support three  lattice sites and represent a lattice analogue of conserved energy momentum tensor we find an additional conserved charge and current with support of nine  sites implying non ergodic behaviour and potentially signalling integrability of the model with a highly nested r matrix structure the second model represents a quantum or stochastic deformation of a recently introduced and studied charged hardpoint lattice gas where particles of different binary charge  and binary velocity  can nontrivially mix upon elastic collisional scattering we show that while the unitary evolution rule of this model does not satisfy the full yang baxter equation it still satisfies an intriguing related identity which gives birth to an infinite set of local conserved operators the so called glider operators\",\"we introduce different ensembles of random lindblad operators  which satisfy quantum detailed balance condition with respect to the given stationary state of size  and investigate their spectral properties such operators are known as davies generators and their eigenvalues are real however their spectral densities depend on  we propose different structured ensembles of random matrices which allow us to tackle the problem analytically in the extreme cases of davies generators corresponding to random with a non degenerate spectrum for the maximally mixed stationary state  interestingly in the latter case the density can be reasonably well approximated by integrating out the imaginary component of the spectral density characteristic to the ensemble of random unconstrained lindblad operators the case of asymptotic states with partially degenerated spectra is also addressed finally we demonstrate that similar universal properties hold for the detailed balance obeying kolmogorov generators obtained by applying superdecoherence to an ensemble of random davies generators in this way we construct an ensemble of random classical generators with imposed detailed balance condition\",\"levy matrices are symmetric random matrices whose entry distributions lie in the domain of attraction of an stable law for  predictions from the physics literature suggest that high dimensional levy matrices should display the following phase transition at a point  eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues in should be delocalized while eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues outside of this interval should be localized further is given by the presumably unique positive solution to  where is an explicit function of and  we prove the following results about high dimensional levy matrices  if then eigenvectors with eigenvalues near are delocalized  if is in the connected components of the set containing  then eigenvectors with eigenvalues near are localized  for sufficiently near or  there is a unique positive solution to  demonstrating the existence of a unique phase transition a if is close to  then scales approximately as  b if is close to  then scales as  our proofs proceed through an analysis of the local weak limit of a levy matrix given by a certain infinite dimensional heavy tailed operator on the poisson weighted infinite tree\",\"in the edge star model with hard constraints we prove the existence of an open set of constraint parameters bisected by a line segment on which there are nonunique entropy optimal graphons related by a symmetry at each point in the open set but off the line segment there is a unique entropy optimizer bipodal and varying analytically with the constraints we also show that throughout another open set containing a different portion of the same line of symmetry there is instead a unique optimal graphon varying analytically with the parameters we explore the extent of these open sets determining the point at which a symmetric graphon ceases to be a local maximizer of the entropy finally we prove some foundational theorems in a general setting relating optimal graphons to the boltzmann entropy and the generic structure of large constrained random graphs\",\"we prove a new shift invariance property of the colored tasep from the shift invariance of the colored stochastic six vertex model proved in borodin gorin wheeler or galashin one can get a shift invariance property of the colored tasep at one time and our result generalizes this to multiple times our proof takes the single time shift invariance as an input and uses analyticity of the probability functions and induction arguments we apply our shift invariance to prove a distributional identity between the finishing times of the oriented swap process and the point to line passage times in exponential last passage percolation which is conjectured by bisi cunden gibbons romik and bufetov gorin romik and is also equivalent to a purely combinatorial identity related to the edelman greene correspondence with known results from last passage percolation we also get new asymptotic results on the colored tasep and the finishing times of the oriented swap process\",\"in this paper we prove that under the condition that a kernel k of a determinantal point process abbr dpp is non zero with some particular non zero associated x determinants any equivalent kernel q of k ie some other kernel of the dpp can be transformed into k by only two possible transformations conjugation andor transposition transformations this substantially builds on an answer from stevens random matrices theory and applications   to a conjecture of bufetov to now include equivalent kernels that are non symmetric\",\"in this paper we derive sufficient conditions for the localization of two dimensional split step quantum walks with a strong shift for this purpose we analyze the zero points of the function introduced by fuda et al quantum inf process    and make these zero points explicit these zeros provide a concrete representation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the evolution operator and in particular clarify where localization occurs in addition the eigenvalues obtained here asymptotically approach threshold resonance in special cases we also describe the display of threshold resonances and generalized eigenfunctions\",\"this is the second in a series of three papers in which we study a lattice gas subject to kawasaki conservative dynamics at inverse temperature in a large finite box whose volume depends on  each pair of neighbouring particles has a negative binding energy  while each particle has a positive activation energy  the initial configuration is drawn from the grand canonical ensemble restricted to the set of configurations where all the droplets are subcritical our goal is to describe in the metastable regime and in the limit as  how and when the system nucleates in the first paper we showed that subcritical droplets behave as quasi random walks in the present paper we use the results in the first paper to analyse how subcritical droplets form and dissolve on multiple space time scales when the volume is moderately large ie with  in the third paper we consider the setting where the volume is very large namely with  where is the energy of the critical droplet in the local model with fixed volume and use the results in the first two papers to identify the nucleation time we will see that in a very large volume critical droplets appear more or less independently in boxes of moderate volume a phenomenon referred to as homogeneous nucleation since kawasaki dynamics is conservative ie particles are preserved we need to control non local effects in the way droplets are formed and dissolved this is done via a deductive approach the tube of typical trajectories leading to nucleation is described via a series of events on which the evolution of the gas consists of droplets wandering around on multiple space time scales\",\"we investigate analytically and numerically the eigenstate thermalization hypothe sis eth in terms of a hermitian operator in the eigenkets selected from the elements of a real complex symmetric random matrix of the gaussian orthogonal ensemble gaussian unitary ensemble according to the theory of random matrices we propose a method to construting the commensurate eigenvector basis that are appropriate for the numerical calculation as well as the diagonal or off diagonal eth diagnostics we also investigate the integrablity chaos transition with independent perturbations in terms of the berry autocorrelation in semicalssical limit where there is a phase space spanned by the momentum like projection and the range of local wave function in such a semiclassical framework we further develop a method which is base on the cor relations of adjacent local points calp to investigate the integrablity chaos transi tion in the presence of uncorrelated peturbations and correlated integrable eigenstate fluctuations which is applicable for both the ergodic and nonergodic systems where the berry autocorrelation is vanishingly small and be nearly one respectively similar to the characteristic of inverse participation ratio ipr\",\"in this paper we construct cumulants for stable random matrix models with single trace interactions of arbitrarily high even order we obtain explicit and convergent expansions for the cumulants we show that any cumulant is an analytic function inside a cardioid domain in the complex plane and we prove their borel leroy summability at the origin of the coupling constant we also prove borel leroy summability of the topological expansion in the genus of the associated maps our proof is uniform in the external variables\",\"motivated by the phenomenon of duality for interacting particle systems we introduce two classes of pfaffian kernels describing a number of pfaffian point processes in the bulk and at the edge using the probabilistic method due to mark kac we prove two szegho type asymptotic expansion theorems for the corresponding fredholm pfaffians the idea of the proof is to introduce an effective random walk with transition density determined by the pfaffian kernel express the logarithm of the fredholm pfaffian through expectations with respect to the random walk and analyse the expectations using general results on random walks we demonstrate the utility of the theorems by calculating asymptotics for the empty interval and non crossing probabilities for a number of examples of pfaffian point processes coalescingannihilating brownian motions massive coalescing brownian motions real zeros of gaussian power series and kac polynomials and real eigenvalues for the real ginibre ensemble\",\"we provide a unified analysis of stable local optima of ising spins with hamiltonians having pair wise interactions and partitions in random weighted graphs where a large number of vertices possess sufficient single spin flip stability for graphs we consider partitions on random graphs where almost all vertices possess sufficient appropriately defined friendlinessunfriendliness for spin glasses we characterize approximate local optima having almost all local magnetic fields of sufficiently large magnitude for nodes as  we prove that the maximum number of vertices possessing such stability undergoes a phase transition from to around a certain value of the stability proving a conjecture from behrens et al through a universality argument we further prove that such a phase transition occurs around the same value of the stability for different choices of interactions specifically ferromagnetic and anti ferromagnetic for sparse graphs as in the large degree limit furthermore we show that after appropriate re scaling the same value of the threshold characterises such a phase transition for the case of fully connected spin glass models our results also allow the characterization of possible energy values of maximally stable approximate local optima our work extends and proves seminal results in statistical physics related to metastable states in particular the work of bray and moore \",\"we consider a process of noncolliding exchangeable random walks on making steps straight and down a single random walk is called exchangeable if under an elementary transposition of the neighboring steps down straight straight down the probability of the trajectory is multiplied by a parameter  our process of noncolliding exchangeable random walks is obtained from the independent exchangeable walks via the doobs transform for a certain nonnegative eigenfunction with the eigenvalue less than  the system of walks evolves in the presence of an absorbing wall at  we show that the trajectory of the noncolliding exchangeable walks started from an arbitrary initial configuration forms a determinantal point process and express its kernel in a double contour integral form this kernel is obtained as a limit from the correlation kernel of distributed random lozenge tilings of sawtooth polygons in the limit as  with fixed and under a suitable scaling of the initial data we obtain a limit shape of our noncolliding walks and also show that their local statistics are governed by the incomplete beta kernel the latter is a distinguished translation invariant ergodic extension of the two dimensional discrete sine kernel\",\"for the discrete random field curie weiss models the infinite volume gibbs states and metastates have been investigated and determined for specific instances of random external fields in general there are not many examples in the literature of non trivial limiting metastates for discrete or continuous spin systems we analyze the infinite volume gibbs states of the mean field spherical model a model of continuous spins in a general random external field with independent identically distributed components with finite moments of some order larger than four and non vanishing variances of the second moments depending on the parameters of the model we show that there exist three distinct phases ordered ferromagnetic ordered paramagnetic and spin glass in the ordered ferromagnetic and ordered paramagnetic phases we show that there exists a unique infinite volume gibbs state almost surely in the spin glass phase we show the existence of chaotic size dependence provide a construction of the aizenman wehr metastate and consider both the convergence in distribution and almost sure convergence of the newman stein metastates the limiting metastates are non trivial and their structure is universal due to the presence of gaussian fluctuations and the spherical constraint\",\"localization results for a class of random schrodinger operators within the hartree fock approximation are proved in two regimes large disorder and weak disorderextreme energies a large disorder threshold analogous to the threshold obtained by schenker in is provided we also show certain stability results for this large disorder threshold by giving examples of distributions for which converges to  or to a number arbitrarily close to it as the interaction strength tends to zero\",\"the restricted solid on solid rsos model is a model of continuous time surface growth characterized by the constraint that adjacent height differences are bounded by a fixed constant though the model is conjectured to belong to the kpz universality class mathematical progress on the model is very sparse we study basic properties of the model and establish bounds on surface height fluctuations as a function of time a linear fluctuation bound is proven for all dimensions and a logarithmic fluctuation lower bound is given for dimension one the proofs rely on a new characterization of rsos as a type of first passage percolation on a disordered lattice which is of independent interest the logarithmic lower bound is established by showing equality in distribution to the minimum of a certain dual rsos process\",\"we compute the tracy widom distribution describing the asymptotic distribution of the largest eigenvalue of a large random matrix by solving a boundary value problem posed by bloemendal the distribution is computed in two ways the first method is a second order finite difference method and the second is a highly accurate fourier spectral method since is simply a parameter in the boundary value problem any can be used in principle the limiting distribution of the th largest eigenvalue can also be computed our methods are available in the julia package tracywidombetajl\",\"in this paper we investigate the liouville property underlining its connection with stochastic completeness and other structural features of the graph we give a characterization of the liouville property in terms of the green function of the graph and use it to prove its equivalence with stochastic completeness on model graphs moreover we show that there exist stochastically incomplete graphs which satisfy the liouville property and prove some comparison theorems for general graphs based on inner outer curvatures we also introduce the dirichlet liouville property of subgraphs and prove that if a graph has a dirichlet liouville subgraph then it is liouville itself as a consequence we obtain that the liouville property is not affected by a finite perturbation of the graph and just as in the continuous setting a graph is liouville provided that at least one of its ends is dirichlet liouville\",\"we study a discrete time markov process on triangular arrays of matrices of size  driven by inverse wishart random matrices the components of the right edge evolve as multiplicative random walks on positive definite matrices with one sided interactions and can be viewed as a dimensional generalisation of log gamma polymer partition functions we establish intertwining relations to prove that for suitable initial configurations of the triangular process the bottom edge has an autonomous markovian evolution with an explicit transition kernel we then show that for a special singular initial configuration the fixed time law of the bottom edge is a matrix whittaker measure which we define to achieve this we perform a laplace approximation that requires solving a constrained minimisation problem for certain energy functions of matrix arguments on directed graphs\",\"we apply takesakis and conness ideas on structure analysis for type iii factors to the study of links a short term of markov kernels appearing in asymptotic representation theory\",\"we study large deviations for random walks on stratified carnot lie groups for such groups there is a natural collection of vectors which generates their lie algebra and we consider random walks with increments in only these directions under certain constraints on the distribution of the increments we prove a large deviation principle for these random walks with a natural rate function adapted to the sub riemannian geometry of these spaces\",\"we show that the multi type stationary distribution of the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process tasep scales to a nontrivial limit around the bernoulli measure of density  this is obtained by showing that the tasep speed process introduced by amir angel and valko scales around the speed to the stationary horizon sh a function valued stochastic process recently introduced and studied by the authors sh is believed to be the universal scaling limit of busemann processes in the kpz universality class our results add to the evidence for this universality by connecting sh with multiclass particle configurations previously sh has been associated with the exponential corner growth model brownian last passage percolation and the directed landscape\",\"this paper establishes universal formulas describing the global asymptotics of two different models of discrete ensembles in high low and fixed temperature regimes our results affirmatively answer a question posed by the second author and sniady we first consider the jack measures on young diagrams of arbitrary size which depend on the inverse temperature parameter and specialize to schur measures when  we introduce a class of jack measures of plancherel type and prove a law of large numbers and central limit theorem in the three regimes in each regime we provide explicit formulas for polynomial observables of the limit shape and gaussian fluctuations around the limit shape these formulas have surprising positivity properties and are expressed in terms of weighted lattice paths we also establish connections between these measures and the work of kerov okounkov olshanski on jack positive specializations and show that this is a rich class of measures parametrized by the elements in the thoma cone second we show that the formulas from limits of plancherel type jack measures are universal they also describe the limit shape and gaussian fluctuations for the second model of random young diagrams of a fixed size defined by jack characters with the approximate factorization property afp studied by the second author and sniady finally we discuss the limit shape in the highlow temperature regimes and show that contrary to the continuous case of ensembles there is a phase transition phenomenon in passing from the fixed temperature regime to the highlow temperature regimes we note that the relation we find between the two different models of random young diagrams appears to be new even in the special case of that relates schur measures to the character measures with the afp studied by biane and sniady\",\"in this paper we prove a polynomial central limit theorem for several integrable models and for the ensembles at high temperatures with polynomial potential furthermore we are able to relate the mean values the variances and the correlations of the moments of these integrable systems with the one of the ensembles moreover we show that for several integrable models the local functions space correlations decay exponentially fast\",\"for a generalized su schrieffer heeger model the energy zero is always critical and hyperbolic in the sense that all reduced transfer matrices commute and have their spectrum off the unit circle disorder driven topological phase transitions in this model are characterized by a vanishing lyapunov exponent at the critical energy it is shown that the integrated density of states away from a transition has a pseudogap with an explicitly computable holder exponent while it has a characteristic divergence dyson spike at the transition points the proof is based on renewal theory for the prufer phase dynamics and the optional stopping theorem for martingales of suitably constructed comparison processes\",\"two proofs of the central limit theorem using a renormalization group approach are presented the first proof is conducted under a third moment assumption and shows that a suitable renormalization group map is a contraction over the space of probability measures with a third moment the second proof uses lyapunov stability and works under a second moment condition these are by far not the most optimal proofs of the clt and the main interest of the proofs are their existence the clt being the simplest case in which a renormalization group argument should apply none of the tools used in this note are new similar proofs are known amongst expert in limit theorems but explicit references are not so easy to come by for non experts in the field\",\"the loop equations for the ensembles are conventionally solved in terms of a expansion we observe that it is also possible to fix and expand in inverse powers of  at leading order for the one point function corresponding to the average of the linear statistic  and specialising the classical weights this reclaims well known results of stieltjes relating the zeros of the classical polynomials to the minimum energy configuration of certain log gas potential energies moreover it is observed that the differential equations satisfied by in the case of classical weights which are particular riccati equations are simply related to the differential equations satisfied by in the

galois theory for conformal nets analogous to the one for vertex operator algebras voa we also outline the case of  dimensional algebraic quantum field theories aqft the aforementioned results make use of families of extreme vacuum state preserving unital completely positive maps acting on the net of von neumann algebras hereafter called quantum operations these are natural generalizations of

of central charge with a finite order automorphism  based on an upper bound derived from this formula we introduce the notion of a generalised deep hole in  then we show that the orbifold construction defines a bijection between the generalised deep holes of the leech lattice vertex operator algebra with non trivial fixed point lie subalgebra and the strongly rational holomorphic vertex operator

methods of showing directly strong locality of a quantum field among them linear energy bounds are the most widely used yet a chiral conformal field of conformal weight cannot admit linear energy bounds in this paper we give a new direct method to prove strong locality in two dimensional conformal field theory we prove that if a chiral conformal field satisfies an energy bound of degree  then it also satisfies a certain local version of the energy bound and this in turn implies strong locality a central role in our proof is played by diffeomorphism symmetry as a concrete application we

correlators of two dimensional rational conformal field theories we obtain concise geometric expressions for the objects describing bulk and boundary fields in terms of idempotents in the cylinder category of the underlying modular fusion category comprising more general classes of fields than is standard in the literature combining these idempotents with frobenius graphs on the world sheet yields string nets that form a consistent system of correlators ie a system of invariants under appropriate mapping class groups that are compatible with factorization using markings we extract operator products of field objects from specific correlators the resulting operator products are natural algebraic expressions that make sense beyond semisimplicity we also derive an eckmann hilton relation internal to a braided category thereby demonstrating the utility of string nets for understanding algebra in braided tensor categories finally we introduce the notion of a universal

whereas the cost functional to be minimized is of tracking type the novelties of the present paper are twofold in addition to the control application the intrinsic difficulties of the optimization problem forced us to first establish new regularity results on the nonlocal cahn hilliard equation that were unknown even without the coupling with a velocity field and are therefore of independent

this new system is studied by means of carleman estimates but unlike other insensitizing problems for scalar models the election of the carleman tools and the overall control strategy depends on the initial choice of the sentinel due to the lack of couplings arising in the extended system finally the local null controllability of the extended nonlinear system and thus the insensitizing property is obtained by applying a local inversion theorem\",\"in this paper we address an optimal distributed control problem for a non local model of phase field type describing the evolution of tumour cells

non existence of positive solutions then we employ the index theory alongside the method of the principle eigenvalue to give a nearly complete classification for the existence and non existence of positive solutions furthermore we show the uniqueness of positive solutions and characterize the asymptotic profile of solutions for small or large diffusion rates of species our results pinpoint the positive role of density dependent dispersal on the population dynamics for the first time by showing that the density dependent dispersal is a beneficial strategy promoting the coexistence of species

step we prove that the associated linear parabolic equations with non constant diffusion coefficients are approximately null controllable by the means of regular controls and that these controls depend continuously to the diffusion coefficient a fixed point strategy is employed in order to prove the null approximate controllability for the considered quasilinear parabolic equations we also show the exact null controllability in arbitrary small time for a class of parabolic equations including the parabolic laplacian with  the theoretical results are numerically illustrated combining a fixed point algorithm and a reformulation of the controllability problem for linear parabolic equation as a mixed formulation which is numerically solved using a finite elements method\",\"we provide an overview of the results on hughes model for pedestrian movements available in the literature after the first successful approaches to solving a regularised version of the model researchers focused

parallel a dpa deterministic particles approximation approach was developed in the spirit of follow the leader approximation results for scalar conservation laws beyond having proved to be powerful

present the main numerical results within the wft and dpa frameworks\",\"the theory of mean field games studies the limiting behaviors of large systems where the agents interact with each other in a certain symmetric way the running and terminal costs are critical for the agents to decide the strategies however in practice they are often partially known or totally unknown for the agents while the total cost is known at the end of the game to address this challenging issue we propose and study several inverse problems for mean field games when the lagrangian is a kinetic energy we first establish unique identifiability results showing that one can recover either the running cost or the terminal cost from knowledge of the total cost if the running cost is limited to the time independent class we can further prove that one can simultaneously recover both the running and the terminal costs finally we extend the results to the setup with general lagrangians\",\"this paper is

smoothing effect and this observation becomes a major obstacle to considering the cauchy problem for dispersive equations under the periodic condition consequently the periodic fifth order mkdv shows a quasilinear phenomenon while the non periodic case can be considered as a semilinear equation in this paper we mainly establish the global well posedness of the fifth order mkdv in the energy space  which is an improvement of the former result by the first author  the main idea to overcome the lack of local smoothing effect is to introduce a suitable frequency dependent short time space

logarithmic divergence appearing in the energy estimates moreover by using examples localized in low and very high frequencies we show that the flow map of the fifth order mkdv equation is not  which

on the half line in the presence of a point interaction at the origin the nonlinearity is of power type and the regime is either subcritical or critical while the point interaction is either attractive or repulsive in the subcritical case we prove that ground states exist for every mass value if the interaction is attractive while ground states exist only for sufficiently large masses if the interaction is repulsive in the latter case if the power is less or equal to four ground states coincide with the only bound state if instead the power is greater than four then there are values of the mass for which two bound states exist and neither of the two is a ground state and values of the mass for which two bound states exist and one of them is a ground state in the critical case we

the absence of dispersion using the natural class of self similar solutions we provide a criterion for blow up in finite time generalising a result by talanov et al in the presence of dispersion we numerically show that the same criterion determines even beyond the semi classical regime whether the solution relaxes or develops a high order rogue wave whose onset time is predicted by the corresponding dispersionless catastrophe time the sign of the chirp appears to determine the prevailing scenario among two competing mechanisms for rogue wave formation for negative values the numerical simulations are suggestive of the dispersive regularisation of a gradient catastrophe described by bertola and tovbis for a different class of smooth bell shaped initial data as the chirp becomes positive the rogue wave seems to result from the interaction of counter propagating dispersive dam break flows as in the box problem recently studied by el khamis and tovbis as the chirp and amplitude of the initial profile are relatively easy to manipulate in optical devices and water tank wave generators we expect our observation to be relevant for experiments in nonlinear optics and fluid dynamics\",\"we are describing relations between schrodingers variational problem and onsagers approach to nonequilibrium statistical mechanics although the second work on reciprocal relations

inverse scattering problem associated with the time harmonic schrodinger equation where both the potential and the source terms are unknown the source term is assumed to be a generalised gaussian random distribution of the microlocally isotropic type whereas the potential function is assumed to be deterministic the well posedness of the forward scattering problem is first established in a proper sense it is then proved that the rough strength of the random source can be uniquely recovered independent of the unknown potential by a single realisation of the passive scattering measurement in addition to the use of a single sample of the passive measurement for two unknowns another significant feature of our result is that there is no geometric restriction on the supports of the source and the potential they can be separated or overlapped or one containing the other\",\"consider the wave equation with heterogeneous coefficients in the homogenization regime at large times the wave

schrodinger equation nls on the waveguide manifold and establish almost sure scattering for random initial data where no symmetry conditions are imposed and the result is available for arbitrarily rough data with  the main new ingredient is a layer by layer refinement of the newly established randomization introduced by shen soffer wu  which enables us to also obtain strongly smoothing effect from the randomization for the forcing term along the periodic direction it is worth noting that such smoothing effect generally can not hold for purely compact manifolds which is on the contrary available for the present model thanks to the mixed type nature of the underlying domain as a byproduct by assuming that the initial data are periodically trivial we also obtain the almost sure scattering for the defocusing cubic nls on which parallels the ones by camps and shen soffer wu  to our knowledge the paper also gives the first almost sure well posedness result for nls on product

kolmogorov equations have been intensively studied mainly assuming that the measure valued processes admit a density and then by exploiting stochastic calculus techniques in hilbert spaces our approach differs from this since we do not assume the existence of a density and we work directly in the context of measures we first formulate two kolmogorov equations of parabolic type one on a

recentred solution converges to the cole hopf solution of the kpz equation this result follows from the analysis of a more general system of nonlinear spdes driven by inhomogeneous noises using the theory of regularity structures however due to inhomogeneity of the noise the black box result developed in the series of works hai bhz ch bcch cannot be applied directly and requires significant extension to infinite dimensional regularity structures analysis of this general system of spdes gives two more interesting results first we prove that the solution of the quenched kpz equation with a

homogenization the bourgain spencer conjecture states that the ensemble averaged solution of a divergence form linear elliptic equation with random coefficients admits an intrinsic description in terms of higher order homogenized equations with an accuracy four times better than the almost sure solution itself while previous rigorous results were restricted to a perturbative regime with small ellipticity ratio we make the very first progress in a non perturbative setting establishing half of the conjectured optimal accuracy the validity of the full conjecture remains an open question and

where the waiting times between two consecutive acceleration reversals are drawn from i an exponential distribution and ii a power law distribution with decay exponent  we compute the mean variance and short time distribution of the position using a trajectory based approach we show that while for the exponential waiting time at long times for the power law case a non trivial algebraic growth emerges where  and for and  respectively interestingly we find that the long time position distribution in case ii is a function of the scaled variable with an dependent scaling function which has qualitatively very different shapes for and  in contrast for case i the typical long time fluctuations of position are gaussian\",\"we consider a probabilistic formulation of a singular two phase stefan problem in one space dimension which amounts to a coupled system of two mckean vlasov stochastic differential equations in the financial context of systemic risk this system models two competing regions with a large number of interconnected banks or firms at risk of default our main result shows the existence of a solution whose discontinuities obey the natural physicality condition

establish a new record this time known as the age of a record has given rise to a growing number of theoretical studies in recent years its importance stems from its crucial role in quantifying record statistics in fields as diverse as physics finance or climate studies until now general methods for determining record age statistics have been limited to observations of either independent random variables or successive positions of a markovian memoryless random walk rw  however as soon as the evolution of a given observable results from the interaction with hidden degrees of freedom memory effects cannot be neglected examples of time series involving memory effects include data of soil and air temperatures river flows nucleotide sequence locations and ethernet traffic here we develop a theoretical framework to determine record age statistics in the presence of memory effects our analytical approach shows that the algebraic decay of the record age distribution is strongly influenced by the past and is characterized by an explicitly determined exponent these theoretical predictions are confirmed by both numerical simulations and experiments on diverse representative non markovian

fashion that physicists enjoy similar issues arise in the field of stochastic calculus which we review to prepare the ground for a proper construction of path integrals at the level of path integration and in arbitrary space dimension we not only report on existing riemannian geometry based approaches that render path integrals amenable to the standard rules of calculus but also bring forth new routes based on a fully time discretized approach that achieve the same goal we illustrate these various definitions of path integration on simple examples such as the diffusion of a

the most general conditions for the reversibility of the diffusion property which includes hypoelliptic and degenerate diffusions and locally lipschitz vector fields we decompose the drift into its time reversible and irreversible parts or equivalently the generator into symmetric and antisymmetric operators we show the equivalence with a decomposition of the backward kolmogorov equation considered in hypocoercivity theory and a decomposition of the fokker planck equation in generic form the main result shows that when the time irreversible part of the drift is in the range of the volatility matrix almost everywhere the forward and time reversed path space measures of the process are mutually equivalent and evaluates the entropy production when this does not hold the measures are mutually singular and the entropy production is infinite we verify these results using exact numerical simulations of linear diffusions we illustrate the discrepancy between the entropy production

show that martingale solutions exist for non negative initial values this advances on existing results in three aspects  non quadratic mobility with not necessarily strictly positive initial data

to solve some abstract cauchy problems further the abstract telegraph damped wave equation is generalized to the case of semi markov perturbations a special attention is devoted to semi markov models of scattering transport processes which can be represented through these evolutions in particular we consider random flights with infinite mean flight times which turn out to be governed by a semi markov generalization of a linear boltzmann equation their scaling limit is proved to converge to superdiffusive transport processes\",\"we prove global schauder estimates for kinetic kolmogorov equations with coefficients that are holder continuous in the spatial variables but only measurable in time compared to other available results in the literature our estimates are optimal in the sense that the inherent holder spaces are the strongest possible under the given assumptions in particular under a parabolic hormander condition we introduce holder norms defined in terms of the intrinsic geometry that the operator induces on the space time variables the technique is based on the existence and the regularity estimates of the fundamental solution of the equation these results are essential for studying backward kolmogorov equations associated with kinetic type diffusions eg stochastic langevin equation\",\"we consider a stochastic conservation law on the line with solution

appropriate centering and scaling converges weakly to the dimensional stochastic heat equation driven by multiplicative space time white noise our result confirms physics predictions and computations in ldt bld hcgcc and is the first rigorous instance of such weak convergence in the moderate deviation regime our proof relies on a certain girsanov transform and works for all howitt warren flows

tensor for a lorentzian conformal four manifold equipped with a twisting non shearing congruence of null geodesics to be locally conformally isometric to such a perturbed fefferman space we investigate the existence of metrics in the perturbed fefferman conformal class satisfying appropriate sub conditions of the einstein equations such as the so called pure radiation equations these metrics are defined only off cross sections of feffermans circle bundle and are conveniently expressed in terms of densities that generalise govers notion of almost einstein scales our setup allows us to reduce the prescriptions on the ricci tensor to the underlying cr three manifold in terms of differential constraints on a complex density and the cr data of the perturbation one form one such constraint turns out to arise from a non linear or gauged analogue of a second order differential operator on densities a solution thereof provides a criterion for the existence of a cr function and under certain conditions for the realisability of the cr three manifold these findings are consistent with previous works by lewandowski nurowski tafel hill and independently by mason we also provide an analysis of the weyl curvature of such conformal structures in terms of the underlying cr data in particular we arrive at a cr formulation of the asymptotic einstein condition by viewing conformal infinity as a cross section of feffermans circle bundle\",\"we apply the strategy to study of diffeomorphisms via block diffeomorphisms to the world of positive scalar curvature psc metrics for each closed psc manifold  we construct the cubical set of all psc block metrics which only encodes concordance information of psc metrics within its homotopy type we show that is a cubical kan set give a geometric description for the group structure of the combinatorial homotopy groups and construct a comparison map from the cubical model of the space of psc metrics on to  next we build a concordance themed model for real theory based on the notion of invertible block dirac operators and use it to factor the index difference through  in the final part of this thesis we construct the psc hatcher

stefan and sussmann carried out fundamental work on singular foliations in the s we survey their contributions show how diffeological objects and ideas arise naturally in this setting and highlight some consequences within diffeology we then introduce a definition of transverse equivalence of singular foliations following molinos definition for regular foliations we show that whereas transverse equivalent singular foliations always have diffeologically diffeomorphic leaf spaces the converse holds only for certain classes of singular foliations we finish by showing that the basic cohomology of a singular foliation is invariant under transverse equivalence\",\"we investigate the geometry of almost robinson manifolds lorentzian analogues of almost hermitian manifolds defined by nurowski and trautman as lorentzian manifolds of even dimension equipped with a totally null complex distribution of maximal rank associated to such a structure there is a congruence of null curves which in dimension four is geodesic and non shearing if and only if the complex distribution is involutive under suitable conditions the distribution gives rise to an almost cauchy riemann structure on the leaf space of the congruence we give a comprehensive classification of such manifolds on the basis of their intrinsic torsion this includes an investigation of the relation between an almost robinson structure and the geometric properties of the leaf space of its congruence we also obtain conformally invariant properties of such a structure and we finally study an analogue of so called generalised optical geometries as introduced by robinson and trautman\",\"the question of which manifolds are spin or spinc has a simple and complete answer in this paper we address the same question for spinh manifolds which are less studied but have appeared in geometry and physics in recent decades we determine that the first obstruction to being spinh is the fifth integral stiefel whitney class w moreover we show that every compact orientable manifold of dimension or lower is spinh and that there are orientable manifolds which are not spinh in all higher dimensions we are then led to consider an infinite sequence of generalised spin structures in doing so we show that there is no integer k such that every manifold embeds in a spin manifold with codimension k\",\"we study conformal transformations of indecomposable lorentzian symmetric spaces of non constant sectional curvature the so called cahen wallach spaces when a cahen wallach space is conformally curved its conformal transformations are homotheties using this we show that a conformal transformation of a conformally curved cahen wallach space is essential if and only if it has a fixed point then we explore the possibility of properly discontinuous groups of conformal transformations acting with a compact orbit space on a conformally curved cahen wallach space we show that any such group cannot centralise an essential homothety and that for cahen wallach spaces of imaginary type must be contained within the isometries\",\"based on the atiyah patodi singer index formula we construct an obstruction to positive scalar curvature metrics with mean convex boundaries on spin manifolds of infinite k area we also characterize the extremal case next we show a general deformation principle for boundary conditions of metrics with lower scalar curvature bounds this implies that the relaxation of boundary conditions often induces weak homotopy equivalences of spaces of such metrics this can be used to refine the smoothing of codimension one singularites a la miao and the deformation of boundary conditions a la brendle marques neves among others finally we construct compact manifolds for which the spaces of positive scalar curvature metrics with mean convex boundaries have nontrivial higher homotopy groups\",\"we describe lorentzian manifolds that admit metric connections with parallel torsion having zero twistorial component and non zero vectorial component we also describe lorentzian manifolds admitting metric connections with closed parallel skew symmetric torsion\",\"in  c l terng associated to each hyperpolar action on a compact symmetric space a hyperpolar proper fredholm pf action on a hilbert space this is a group action by an infinite dimensional path group and it acts on a hilbert space via the gauge transformations those two hyperpolar actions are related through an equivariant riemannian submersion called the parallel transport map and they have close relations to the infinite dimensional symmetric spaces called affine kac moody symmetric spaces in this paper we define a linear isomorphism between hilbert spaces and show that it is equivariant with respect to the gauge transformations and is compatible with the parallel transport map using this isomorphism we extend and unify all known computational results of principal curvatures of pf submanifolds in hilbert spaces especially we study the submanifold geometry of orbits of hyperpolar pf actions associated to sigma actions and give new examples of austere pf submanifolds in hilbert spaces moreover we show that the isomorphism between hilbert spaces given here corresponds to a natural isomorphism between affine kac moody symmetric spaces of group type\",\"associated to any affine space a endowed with a metric structure of arbitrary signature we consider the space of affine functionals operating on the space of quadratic functions of a on this functional space we characterize a symmetric bilinear form derived from the metric structure in a functorial way we explore the geometrical relations of the relevant objects in this new metric space their properties encode all characteristics known in the literature for euclidean squared distance matrices cayley menger matrices and determinants squared distance coordinate systems and lie and mobius sphere geometries birthing this form as cayley menger product it represents a geometrical foundation unifying results in all these areas extending them to metric affine spaces or bundles\",\"we express the total space of a principal circle bundle over a connected sum of two manifolds in terms of the total spaces of circle bundles over each summand provided certain conditions hold we then apply this result to provide sufficient conditions for the existence of free circle and torus actions on connected sums of products of spheres and obtain a topological classification of closed simply connected manifolds with a free cohomogeneity four torus action as a corollary we obtain infinitely many manifolds with riemannian metrics of positive ricci curvature and isometric torus actions\",\"the surgery theorem of wraith states that positive ricci curvature is preserved under surgery if certain metric and dimensional conditions are satisfied we generalize this theorem as follows instead of attaching a product of a sphere and a disc we glue a sphere bundle over a manifold with a so called core metric a type of metric which was recently introduced by burdick to construct metrics of positive ricci curvature on connected sums as applications we construct core metrics on sphere bundles where the base admits a core metric and obtain new examples of manifolds with metrics of positive ricci curvature\",\"we describe all lorentzian semi direct extensions of the heisenberg group which are conformally einstein as a by side result bach flat left invariant lorentzian metrics on semi direct extensions of the

on three dimensional lorentzian lie groups \",\"we give examples of spin manifolds with boundary that do not admit metrics of positive scalar curvature and nonnegative mean curvature these manifolds in fact have the stronger property that the conformal laplacian with appropriate boundary conditions is never positive the obstruction to the positivity of the conformal laplacian is given by a real valued invariant associated to the aps theorem for the twisted dirac operator we use analytic techniques related to the prescribed scalar curvature problem in conformal geometry to move beyond earlier work where the metric is a product near the boundary\",\"we show that an odd dimensional closed manifold with positive curvature cannot contain an incompressible real projective plane in the sense that there is no map of the projective plane into the manifold which is nontrivial on both first and second homotopy groups another way to say this is that no element of the fundamental group reverses the orientation of a class in the second homotopy group further we show that for a manifold of dimension divisible by four with positive curvature the fundamental group acts trivially on the second homotopy group the methods involve a careful study of the stability of minimal two spheres in manifolds of positive curvature\",\"we study semi riemannian submanifolds of arbitrary codimension in a lie group equipped with a bi invariant metric in particular we show that if the normal bundle of is closed under the lie bracket then any normal jacobi operator of equals the square of the associated invariant shape operator  this permits to understand curvature adaptedness to geometrically in terms of left translations for example in the case where is a riemannian hypersurface our main result states that the normal jacobi operator commutes with the ordinary shape operator precisely when the left invariant extension of each of its eigenspaces has first order tangency with along all the others as a further consequence of the equality  we obtain a new case independent proof of a well known fact every three dimensional lie group equipped with a bi invariant semi riemannian metric has constant curvature\",\"we prove that for a closed oriented smooth spin manifold with non zero signature the dehn twist about a or sphere in is not homotopic to any finite order diffeomorphism in particular we negatively answer the nielsen realization problem for each group generated by the mapping class of a dehn twist we also show that there is a discrepancy between the nielsen realization

a spatially flat friedmann lemaitre robertson walker geometry where the equation of motion for the nonmetricity scalar is not trivially identity from the analysis of dynamics we found that the de sitter universe is always an attractor while the cosmological models admit scaling solutions which can describe the early acceleration phase of our universe or the matter and the radiation

aspherical gravitating body we introduce coordinate systems to describe light propagation in the earths vicinity along with the relevant coordinate transformations and discuss the transformations between proper and coordinate times we represent the earths gravitational field using cartesian symmetric trace free stf mass multipole moments the light propagation equation is solvable along the trajectory of a light ray to all stf orders  although we focus primarily on the quadrupole  octupole  and hexadecapole  cases our approach is valid to all orders we express the stf moments via spherical harmonic coefficients of various degree and order  the result is the gravitational phase shift expressed in terms of the spherical harmonics these results are new we also consider contributions due to tides and the earths rotation we estimate the characteristic magnitudes of each term of the resulting overall gravitational phase shift the terms assessed are either large enough to impact current generation clocks or will become significant as future generation clocks offer greater sensitivity our formulation is useful for many practical and scientific applications including space based time and frequency transfers relativistic geodesy and navigation as well as quantum communication links and space based tests of fundamental physics\",\"in this brief note we aim to provide through a well known class of singular densities in harmonic analysis a simple approach to the fact that the homogeneity of the universe on scales of the order of a hundred millions light years is completely compatible with the fine scale condensation of matter and energy we give precise and quantitative definitions of homogeneity and isotropy on large scales then we show that muckenhoupt densities have the ingredients required to a model for the large scale homogeneity and the fine scale condensation of the universe in particular these densities can take locally infinitely large values black holes and at once in the large scales they are independent of the location we also show some locally singular densities satisfying the large scale isotropy property\",\"in this work

content consists of two charged dust species this comes motivated by the fact that static configurations are possible with one dust but only if it is electrically counterpoised dust in order to have such dust the quotient between electric charge density and mass density needs to be fine tuned to a value that is far less than the charge mass quotient for any known particle here we prove that there are no static configurations with two dust species unless each one is electrically counterpoised dust this shows that electrically counterpoised dust spacetimes can not be made with matter that has on average the correct charge mass ratio but that the underlying particles must have such ratio\",\"we study the properties of spacelike singularities in spherically symmetric spacetimes obeying the

singularity obeying several reasonable assumptions is formed then the hawking mass the kretschmann scalar and the matter fields have inverse polynomial blow up rates near the singularity that may be described precisely furthermore one may view the resulting spacetime in the context of the bkl heuristics regarding space like singularities in relativistic cosmology in particular near any point on the singular boundary in our spherically symmetric spacetime we obtain a leading order bkl type expansion including a description of kasner exponents associated to  this provides a rigorous description of a detailed correspondence between kasner like singularities most often associated to the cosmological setting and the singularities observed in spherically symmetric gravitational

local cauchy problem for polarized symmetric solutions to the einstein vacuum equations featuring the nonlinear interaction of three small amplitude impulsive gravitational waves such solutions are characterized by their three singular wave fronts across which the curvature tensor is allowed to admit a delta singularity under polarized symmetry the einstein vacuum equations reduce to the einstein scalar field system in dimensions in this paper we focus on the wave estimates for the scalar field in the reduced system the scalar field terms are the most singular ones in the problem with the scalar field only being lipschitz initially we use geometric commutators to prove energy estimates which reflect that the singularities are localized and that the scalar field obeys additional fractional derivative regularity as well as regularity along appropriately defined good directions the main challenge is to carry out all these estimates using only the low regularity properties of the metric finally we prove an anisotropic sobolev embedding lemma which when combined with our energy estimates shows that the scalar field is everywhere lipschitz and that it obeys additional estimates away from the most singular region\",\"we evaluate the em three dimensional em non axis symmetric em time dependent newton potential generated by a pair of mutually orbiting objects such as pairs of ordinary or neutron stars and in some approximations black holes spinning around each other the vertical component of the gravitational force that is that orthogonal to the plane of their

distinguish a curved dimensional spacetime from a flat one when it is possible relying only on the causality relations between events it is known that it is possible only for spacetimes that are not

studies of the klein gordon equation unlike hyperbolic coordinates the desc boundary fibration structure is poincare invariant\",\"we prove the existence of instabilities for the geometric linear wave equation on extremal kerr spacetime backgrounds which describe stationary black holes rotating at their maximally allowed angular velocity these instabilities can be associated to non axisymmetric azimuthal modes and are stronger than the axisymmetric instabilities discovered by aretakis in are the existence of non axisymmetric instabilities follows from a derivation of very precise stability properties of solutions we determine therefore the precise global leading order late time behaviour of solutions supported on a bounded set of azimuthal modes via energy estimates in both physical and frequency space in particular we obtain sharp uniform decay in time estimates and we determine the coefficients and rates of inverse polynomial late time tails everywhere in the exterior of extremal kerr black holes we also demonstrate how non axisymmetric instabilities leave an imprint on future null infinity via the coefficients appearing in front of slowly decaying and oscillating late time tails\",\"in  klainerman and nicolo proved the stability of minkowski in the case of the exterior of an outgoing null cone relying on the method used in  caciotta and nicolo proved the stability of kerr spacetime in external regions ie outside an outgoing null cone far away from the kerr event horizon in this paper we give a new proof of  compared to  we reduce the number of derivatives needed in the proof simplify the treatment of the last slice and provide a unified treatment of the decay of initial data which contains in particular the initial data considered by klainerman and szeftel in  also concerning the treatment of curvature estimates similar to  we replace the vectorfield method used in by weighted estimates introduced by dafermos and rodnianski in \",\"in this paper we study the global existence and completeness of classical solutions of gravity coupled a scalar field system called einstein klein gordon system in higher dimensions we introduce a new ansatz function to reduce the problem into a single first order integro differential equation then we employ the contraction mapping in the appropriate banach space using banach fixed theorem we show that there exists a unique fixed point which is the solution of the theory for a given initial data we prove the existence of both local and global classical solutions we also study the completeness properties of the spacetimes here we introduce a mass like function for in bondi coordinates the completeness of spacetimes along the future directed time like lines outward to a region which resembles the event horizon of the black hole\",\"in the previous works i rodnianski and y shlapentokh rothman naked singularities for the einstein vacuum equations the exterior solution arxiv and y shlapentokh rothman naked singularities for the einstein vacuum equations the interior solution arxiv we have introduced a new type of self similarity for the einstein vacuum equations characterized by the fact that the homothetic vector field may be spacelike on the past light cone of the singularity in this work we give a systematic treatment of this new self similarity in particular we provide geometric characterizations of spacetimes admitting the new symmetry and show the existence and uniqueness of formal expansions around the past null cone of the singularity which may be considered analogues of the well known fefferman graham expansions in combination with previous results our analysis will show that the twisted self similar solutions are sufficiently general to describe all possible asymptotic behaviors for spacetimes in the small data regime which are self similar and whose homothetic vector field is everywhere spacelike on an initial spacelike hypersurface we present an application of this later fact to the understanding of the global structure of fefferman graham spacetimes and the naked singularity exteriors of i rodnianski and y shlapentokh rothman naked singularities for the einstein vacuum equations the exterior solution arxiv lastly we observe that by an amalgamation of techniques from previous works one may associate true solutions to the einstein vacuum equations to each of our formal expansions in a suitable region of spacetime\",\"we present a novel approach to the analysis of regularity and decay for solutions of wave equations in a neighborhood of null infinity in asymptotically flat spacetimes of any dimension the classes of metrics and wave type operators we consider near null infinity include those arising in nonlinear stability problems for einsteins field equations in dimensions in a neighborhood of null infinity in an appropriate compactification of the spacetime to a manifold with corners the wave operators are of edge type at null infinity and totally characteristic at spacelike and future timelike infinity on a corresponding scale of sobolev spaces we demonstrate how microlocal regularity propagates across or into null infinity via a sequence of radial sets as an application inspired by work of the second author with baskin and wunsch we prove regularity and decay estimates for forward solutions of wave type equations on asymptotically flat spacetimes which are asymptotically homogeneous with respect to scaling in the forward timelike cone and have an appropriate structure at null infinity these estimates are new even for the wave operator on minkowski space the results obtained here are also used as black boxes in a global theory of wave type equations on asymptotically flat and asymptotically stationary spacetimes developed by the first author\",\"exact solutions to an einstein maxwelle d m system with an electric current are simple models of global cosmic magnetic phenomena in the universe in this paper we consider an e d m system with two chiral spinors coupled with a gauge field and an electromagnetic field  we construct a family of exact solutions to the e d m system on four dimensional static sasakian spacetimes the electromagnetic field in the solutions is a contact magnetic field and the chiral spinors are induced from sasakian quasi killing spinors we find closed universe models whose weak energy condition holds and open universe models whose weak energy condition is violated in this study we introduce the sasakian frame which is used to prospectively discuss the properties of sasakian quasi killing spinors a simple description of sasakian quasi killing spinors of a certain type is obtained\",\"we prove that solutions to linear wave equations in a subextremal kerr de sitter spacetime have asymptotic expansions in quasinormal modes up to a decay order given by the normally hyperbolic trapping extending the existing results the main novelties are a different way of obtaining a fredholm setup that defines the quasinormal modes and a new analysis of the trapping of lightlike geodesics in the kerr de sitter spacetime both of which apply in the full subextremal range in particular this reduces the question of decay for solutions to wave equations to the question of mode stability\",\"we study the massless vlasov equation on the exterior of the subextremal and extremal reissner nordstrom spacetimes we prove that moments decay at an exponential rate in the subextremal case and at a polynomial rate in the extremal case this polynomial rate is shown to be sharp along the event horizon in the extremal case we show that transversal derivatives of certain components of the energy momentum tensor do not decay along the event horizon if the solution and its first time derivative are initially supported on a neighbourhood of the event horizon the non decay of transversal derivatives in the extremal case is compared to the work of aretakis on instability for the wave equation unlike aretakis results for the wave equation which exploit a hierarchy of conservation laws our proof is based entirely on a quantitative analysis of the geodesic flow and conservation laws do not feature in the present work\",\"analytic modeling of gravitational waves from inspiraling eccentric binaries poses an interesting mathematical challenge when constructing analytic waveforms in the frequency domain one has to contend with the fact that the phase of the fourier integral in non monotonic resulting in a breakdown of the standard stationary phase approximation in this work we study this breakdown within the context of catastrophe theory we find that the stationary phase approximation holds in the context of eccentric keplerian orbits when the fourier frequency satisfies  where are integer multiples of the apocenterpericenter frequencies respectively for values outside of this interval the phase undergoes a fold catastrophe giving rise to an airy function approximation of the fourier integral using these two different approximations we generate a matched asymptotic expansion that approximates generic fourier integrals of keplerian motion for bound orbits across all frequency values this asymptotic expansion is purely analytic and closed form we discuss several applications of this investigation and the resulting approximation specifically  the development and improvement of effective fly by waveforms  the transition from burst emission in the high eccentricity limit to wave like emission in the quasi circular limit which results in an analogy between eccentric gravitational wave bursts and bose einstein condensates and  the calculation of f mode amplitudes from stars in eccentric orbits in terms of complex hansen coefficients the techniques and approximations developed herein are generic and will be useful for future studies of gravitational waves from eccentric binaries within the context of post newtonian theory\",\"in the framework of the nonlinear stability of minkowski spacetime we show that if the radiation field of the curvature tensor vanishes the spacetime must be flat\",\"we consider the duality between general relativity and the theory of einstein algebras in the extended setting where one permits non hausdorff manifolds we show that the duality breaks down and then go on to discuss a sense in which general relativity formulated using non hausdorff manifolds exhibits excess structure when compared to einstein algebras we discuss how these results bear on a class of algebraically motivated deflationist views about spacetime ontology we conclude with a conjecture concerning non hausdorff spacetimes with no bifurcating curves\",\"addressing a long standing problem we show that every van stockum dust can be matched to a parametric family of non static papapetrou vacuum metrics and the converse the boundary if existing is determined by vanishing of certain first order invariant on the vacuum side moreover we establish a relation to ehlers and kramer neugebauer transformations which allows us to look for dust clouds with a prescribed boundary explicit examples include the bonnor metric and a new vacuum exterior to the lanczos van stockum dust metric as well as dust clouds with nontrivial topology\",\"we show how the gambier equation arises in connection to friedmann lematre robertson walker flrw cosmology and a dark matter equation of state moreover we provide a correspondence between the friedmann equations and the gambier equations that possess the painlev property in dimensions we also consider special cases of the gambier g equation such as the generalized pinney equation for an extended flrw model with dynamic scalar field as matter model the einstein equations correspond to the milne pinney equation which in turn can be mapped to the parametric gambier equation of second order\",\"we consider the vacuum einstein field equations under the belinski zakharov symmetries depending on the chosen signature of the metric these spacetimes contain most of the well known special solutions in general relativity including well known black holes in this paper we prove global existence of small belinski zakharov spacetimes under a natural nondegeneracy condition we also construct new energies and virial functionals to provide a description of the energy decay of smooth global cosmological metrics inside the light cone finally some applications are presented in the case of generalized kasner solitons\",\"it is common folklore that semiclassical gravity suggests that in the process of black hole formation and subsequent evaporation by hawking radiation an initially pure state can evolve into a mixed state this is known as the emphinformation loss puzzle or it paradox here we argue that a quantum version of strong cosmic censorship for which we give a conjectural statement and has strong supporting evidence indicates that the semiclassical description of the evaporation process breaks down at the final evaporation stage we argue further that if taken at face value semiclassical gravity predicts the development of a future singularity instead of a post evaporation region where quantum and classical predictability breaks down and where information is lost we thus argue that there are no reasons to expect a failure of unitarity or predictability for any quantum gravity theory that can cure spacetime singularities as this is not even suggested by semiclassical arguments\",\"we discuss a teleparallel version of newton cartan gravity this theory arises as a formal large speed of light limit of the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity tegr thus it provides a geometric formulation of the newtonian limit of tegr similar to standard newton cartan gravity being the newtonian limit of general relativity we show how by a certain gauge fixing the standard formulation of newtonian gravity can be recovered\",\"inflationary spacetimes have been argued to be past geodesically incomplete in many situations however whether the geodesic incompleteness implies the existence of an initial spacetime curvature singularity or whether the spacetime may be extended potentially into another phase of the universe is generally unknown both questions have important physical implications in this paper we take a closer look at the geometrical structure of inflationary spacetimes and investigate these very questions we first classify which past inflationary histories have a scalar curvature singularity and which might be extendible andor non singular in homogeneous and isotropic cosmology with flat spatial sections then we derive rigorous extendibility criteria of various regularity classes for quasi de sitter spacetimes that evolve from infinite proper time in the past finally we show that beyond homogeneity and isotropy special continuous extensions respecting the einstein field equations with a perfect fluid must have the equation of state of a de sitter universe asymptotically an interpretation of our results is that past eternal inflationary scenarios are most likely physically singular except in situations with very special initial conditions\",\"how does one measure the angular momentum carried away by gravitational radiation during the merger of a binary black hole this has been a subtle issue since the s due to the discovery of supertranslation ambiguity the angular momentum recorded by two distant observers of the same system may not be the same in this talk i shall describe how the theory of quasilocal mass and optimal isometric embedding identifies a new definition of angular momentum that is free of any supertranslation ambiguity this is based on joint work with po ning chen jordan keller ye kai wang and shing tung yau\",\"no hopf rinow theorem is possible in lorentzian geometry nonetheless we prove that a spacetime is globally hyperbolic if and only if it is metrically complete with respect to the null distance of a time function our approach is based on the observation that null distances behave particularly well for weak temporal functions in terms of regularity and causality specifically the null distances of cauchy temporal functions and regular cosmological time functions encode causality globally\",\"inspired by some lorentzian versions of the notion of metric and length space introduced by kunzinger and samman and more recently by muller and minguzzi and suhr we revisit the notion of lorentzian metric space in order to later construct the c completion of these general objects we not only prove that this construction is feasible in great generality for these objects including spacetimes of low regularity but also endow the c completion with a structure of lorentzian metric space by itself we also prove that the c completion constitutes a well suited extension of the original space which really completes it in a precise sense and becomes sensible to certain causal properties of that space\",\"we prove an equivalence between the classical equations of motion governing vacuum gravity compactifications and more general warped product spacetimes and a concavity property of entropy under time evolution this is obtained by linking the theory of optimal transport to the raychaudhuri equation in the internal space where the warp factor introduces effective notions of curvature and negative internal dimension when the reduced energy condition is satisfied concavity can be characterized in terms of the cosmological constant  as a consequence the masses of the spin two kaluza klein fields obey bounds in terms of alone we show that some cheeger bounds on the kk spectrum hold even without assuming synthetic ricci lower bounds in the large class of infinitesimally hilbertian metric measure spaces which includes d brane and o plane singularities as an application we show how some approximate string theory solutions in the literature achieve scale separation and we construct a new explicit parametrically scale separated ads solution of m theory supported by casimir energy\",\"i discuss the impact of the positive cosmological constant on the interplay between the equivalence principle in general relativity and the rules of quantum mechanics at the non relativistic level there is an ambiguity in the definition of a phase of a wave function measured by inertial and accelerating observes this is the cosmological analogue of the penrose effect which can also be seen as a non relativistic limit of the unruh effect the symmetries of the associated schrodinger equation are generated by the newton hooke algebra which arises from a non relativistic limit of a cosmological twistor space\",\"we are interested in the charged dust solutions of the einstein field equations in stationary and axially symmetric spacetimes and inquire if the naked singularities of the israel wilson perjes iwp metrics can be removed the answer is negative in four dimensions we examine whether this negative result can be avoided by adding scalar or dilaton fields we show that iwp metrics also arise as solutions of the einstein maxwell system with a stealth dilaton field we determine the iwp metrics completely in terms of one complex function satisfying the laplace equation with the inclusion of the stealth dilaton field it is now possible to add a perfect fluid source in this case the field equations reduce to a complex cubic equation hence this procedure provides interior solutions to each iwp metric and it is possible to cover all naked singularities inside a compact surface where there is matter distribution\",\"i characterize the lorentzian manifolds properly isometrically embeddable in minkowski spacetime ie the lorentzian submanifolds of minkowski spacetime that are also closed subsets moreover i prove that the lorentzian manifolds that can be properly conformally embedded in minkowski spacetime coincide with the globally hyperbolic spacetimes finally by taking advantage of the embedding i obtain an infinitesimal version of the distance formula\",\"in this paper we initiate the study of characteristic event horizon gluing in vacuum more precisely we prove that minkowski space can be glued along a null hypersurface to any round symmetry sphere in a schwarzschild black hole spacetime as a solution of the einstein vacuum equations the method of proof is fundamentally nonperturbative and is closely related to our previous work in spherical symmetry ku and christodoulous short pulse method chr we also make essential use of the perturbative characteristic gluing results of aretakis czimek rodnianski acra cr as an immediate corollary of our methods we obtain characteristic gluing of minkowski space to the event horizon of very slowly rotating kerr with prescribed mass and specific angular momentum  using our characteristic gluing results we construct examples of vacuum gravitational collapse to very slowly rotating kerr black holes in finite advanced time with prescribed and  our construction also yields the first example of a spacelike singularity arising from one ended asymptotically flat gravitational collapse in vacuum\",\"we briefly recount the long friendship that developed between ludwig and us moshe flato and i since we first met at icm in moscow that friendship extended to his school and family and persists to this day its strong personal impact and main scientific components are sketched including reflexions on what mathematical physics is or should be\",\"in this work we prove that assuming some reasonable hypotheses an electromagnetic energy tensor that can be coupled with the lovelock lanczos tensor in einstein gauss bonnet gravities cannot exist\",\"the waveform of a binary black hole coalescence appears to be both simple and universal in this essay we argue that the dynamics should admit a separation into fast and slow degrees of freedom such that the latter are described by an integrable system of equations accounting for the simplicity and universality of the waveform given that painleve transcendents are a smoking gun of integrable structures we propose the painleve ii transcendent as the key structural element threading a hierarchy of asymptotic models aiming at capturing different effective layers in the dynamics wards conjecture relating integrable and antiself dual solutions can provide the avenue to encode background binary black hole data in non local twistor structures\",\"we study the dynamics of the field equations in a four dimensional isotropic and homogeneous spatially flat friedmann lemaitre robertson walker geometry in the context of einstein gauss bonnet theory with a matter source and a scalar field coupled to the gauss bonnet scalar in this theory the gauss bonnet term contributes to the field equations the mass of the scalar field depends on the potential function and the gauss bonnet term for the scalar field potential we consider the exponential function and the coupling function between the scalar field and the gauss bonnet scalar is considered to be the linear function moreover the scalar field can have a phantom behaviour we consider a set of dimensionless variables and write the field equations into a system or algebraic differential equations for the latter we investigate the equilibrium points and their stability properties in order to perform a global analysis of the asymptotic dynamics we use compactified variables this gravitational theory can explain the universes recent and past acceleration phases therefore it can be used as a toy model for studying inflation or as a dark energy candidate\",\"we show that the maximal globally hyperbolic solution of the initial value problem for the higher dimensional vacuum einstein equations on two transversally intersecting characteristic hypersurfaces contains a future neighborhood of the hypersurfaces\",\"we give a simplified approach to kunzinger  saemanns theory of lorentzian length spaces in the globally hyperbolic regularly localizable case these provide a nonsmooth framework for general relativity we close a gap in this setting by showing consistency of two potentially different notions of timelike geodesic segments used in the literature we propose a nonsmooth reformulation of penrose null energy condition in terms of the timelike curvature dimension conditions of cavalletti  mondino and braun and discuss its consistency and stability properties this yields new insights even in the smooth setting\",\"we prove microlocal estimates with normally hyperbolic trapping we use a new type of symbol class which is constructed by blowing up the intersection of the unstable manifold and the fiber infinity the extra loss of the microlocal estimates compared with the standard propagation of singularities is arbitrarily small\",\"we study the massive scalar field equation on a stationary and spherically symmetric black hole including in particular the schwarzschild and reissner nordstrom black holes in the full sub extremal range for solutions projected on a fixed spherical harmonic our problem involves the scattering of an attractive long range potential coulomb like and thus cannot be treated perturbatively we prove precise point wise asymptotic tails of the form  where is an explicit oscillating profile our asymptotics appear to be the first rigorous decay result for a massive scalar field on a black hole establishing these asymptotics is also an important step in retrieving the assumptions used in work of the third author regarding the interior of dynamical black holes and strong cosmic censorship\",\"we derive the lie point symmetries for the mit bag model for quark stars in relativistic astrophysics four cases of reduction arise three cases of specific values of the measure of the anisotropy variation and one general case which we postulate as a specific relationship between the two gravitational potentials we demonstrate the applicability of the model by generating two closed form solutions that satisfy the master gravitational equation and we match the interior geometries of the gravitating hyperspheres with the external solution given by the reissner nordstrom metric at the stellar boundary lastly we produce a general class of solutions that are attainable for smooth and continuous functions and generate two exact solutions using this model\",\"the quest for complete observables in general relativity has been a longstanding open problem we employ methods from descriptive set theory to show that no complete observable is borel definable in fact we show that it is consistent with the zermelo fraenkel and dependent choice axioms that no complete observable exists whatsoever in a nutshell this implies that the problem of observables is toanalysis what the delian problem was to straightedge and compass our results remain true even after restricting the space of solutions to vacuum solutions in other words the issue can be traced to the presence of local degrees of freedom in general relativity\",\"i compute the rate of change of mass and angular momentum of a black hole namely tidal heating in an eccentric orbit the change is caused due to the tidal field of the orbiting companion i compute the result for both the spinning and non spinning black holes in the leading order of the mean motion namely  i demonstrate that the rates get enhanced significantly for nonzero eccentricity since eccentricity in a binary evolves with time i also express the results in terms of an initial eccentricity and azimuthal frequency  in the process i developed a prescription that can be used to compute all physical quantities in a series expansion of initial eccentricity  this result was only known in the leading order while ignoring the contribution of the spin on the eccentricity evolution although the eccentricity evolution result still ignores the spin effect in the current work the prescription can be used to compute higher order corrections of initial eccentricity post leading order using this result i computed the rate of change of mass and angular momentum of a black hole in terms of initial eccentricity and azimuthal frequency up to \",\"we initiate an investigation into separable but physically reasonable states in relativistic quantum field theory in particular we will consider the minimum amount of energy density needed to ensure the existence of separable states between given spacelike separated regions this is a first step towards improving our understanding of the balance between entanglement entropy and energy density which is of great physical interest in its own right and also in the context of black hole thermodynamics we will focus concretely on a linear scalar quantum field in a topologically trivial four dimensional globally hyperbolic spacetime for rather general spacelike separated regions and we prove the existence of a separable quasi free hadamard state in minkowski spacetime we provide a tighter construction for massive free scalar fields given any we construct a quasi free hadamard state which is stationary homogeneous spatially isotropic and separable between any two regions in an inertial time slice all of whose points have a distance  we also show that the normal ordered energy density of these states can be made in planck units to achieve these results we use a rather explicit construction of test functions of positive type for which we can get sufficient control on lower bounds on \",\"we uncover hidden spectral symmetries of the teukolsky equation in kerr de sitter black holes recently conjectured by aminov grassi and hatsuda arxiv  and arxiv   in the zero cosmological constant case using these symmetries we provide a new simpler proof of mode stability for subextremal kerr black holes we also present a partial mode stability result for kerr de sitter black holes\",\"we establish the existence of a broad class of asymptotically euclidean solutions to einsteins constraint equations whose asymptotic behavior at infinity is prescribed the seed to solution method proposed in this paper encompasses vacuum as well as matter spaces and relies on iterations based on the linearized einstein operator and its dual it generates a riemannian manifold with finitely many asymptotically euclidean ends from any seed data set consisting of  a riemannian metric and a symmetric two tensor and  a density field and a momentum vector field representing the matter content we distinguish between tame or strongly tame seed data sets depending whether the data provides a rough or an accurate asymptotic ansatz at infinity we encompass classes of metrics and matter fields with the weakest possible decay with infinite adm mass or strongest possible decay with schwarzschild behavior our analysis is motivated by carlotto and schoens pioneering work on the localization problem dealing with metrics with very low decay and establishing estimates that include and go beyond harmonic decay require significantly new arguments which are developed here we work in a weighted lebesgue holder framework adapted to the given seed data and analyze the nonlinear coupling between the hamiltonian and momentum constraints by establishing elliptic estimate for linearized einstein operator and its dual we uncover the notion of mass momentum correctors related to the adm mass of the manifold furthermore we introduce and study the asymptotic localization in which we replace carlotto schoens exact localization by an asymptotic condition at a super harmonic rate by applying our method with a suitably constructed parametrized family of seed data we solve this problem by moreover exhibiting mass momentum correctors with harmonic decay\",\"we find three new exact solutions of the vacuum einstein equations without cosmological constant in more than three dimensions we consider globally hyperbolic spacetimes in which almost abelian lie groups act on the spaces isometrically and simply transitively we give left invariant metrics on the spaces and solve ricci flat conditions of the spacetimes in the four dimensional case our solutions correspond to the bianchi type ii vacuum solution by our results and previous studies all spatially homogeneous solutions whose spaces have zero dimensional moduli spaces of left invariant metrics are found for the simplest solution we show that each of the spatial dimensions cannot expand or contract simultaneously in the late time limit\",\"in this paper we prove a closure result for globally hyperbolic spacetimes satisfying at a certain time natural assumptions on the deceleration the pressure and the hubble constant the main tool that we use is a general bonnet myers type result\",\"angular power spectra are central to the study of our universe in this paper i develop a new method for the numeric evaluation and analytic estimation of the angular cross power spectrum of two random fields using complex analysis and picard lefschetz theory the proposed continuous deformation of the integration domain resums the highly oscillatory integral into a convex integral whose integrand decays exponentially this deformed integral can be quickly evaluated with conventional integration techniques these methods can be used to quickly evaluate and estimate the angular power spectrum from the three dimensional power spectrum for all angles or multipole moments this method is especially useful for narrow redshift bins or samples with small redshift overlap for which the limber approximation has a large error\",\"we consider the long time behavior of solutions to scalar field models appearing in the theory of cosmological inflation oscillons and cold dark matter in presence or absence of the cosmological constant these models are not included in standard mathematical literature due to their unusual nonlinearities which model different features to classical ones here we prove that these models fit in the theory of dispersive decay by computing new virials adapted to their setting several important examples candidates to model both effects are studied in detail\",\"we provide two novel ways to compute the surface gravity  and the hawking temperature of a stationary black hole in the first method is given as the three volume integral of the gauss bonnet invariant or the kretschmann scalar for ricci flat metrics in the total region outside the event horizon in the second method it is given as the surface integral of the riemann tensor contracted with the covariant derivative of a killing vector on the event horizon to arrive at these new formulas for the black hole temperature and the related surface gravity we first construct a

topological boundary condition constraining phase transitions on the boundary\",\"we consider area preserving deformations of the plane acting on electronic wavefunctions through quantomorphisms that change both the underlying metric and the confining potential we show that adiabatic sequences of such transformations produce berry phases that can be written in closed form in terms of the many body current and density even in the presence of interactions for a large class of deformations that generalize squeezing and shearing the leading piece of the phase is a super extensive aharonov bohm term proportional to n for n electrons in the thermodynamic limit its gauge invariant subleading partner only measures the current whose dominant contribution to the phase stems from a jump at the edge in

kitaevs sixteen fold way of anyon theories defining a one dimensional d path through all the lattice sites and performing the jordan wigner transformation with the help of the d path we find that such a spin  model is equivalent to a model with species of majorana fermions coupled to a static gauge field here each specie of majorana fermions gives rise to an energy band that carries a chern number  yielding a total chern number  it has been shown that the ground states are three four fold topologically degenerate on a torus when is an odd even number these exactly solvable models can be achieved

parton like and whose excitations display either abelian or non abelian braiding statistics we prove ground state energy monotonicity theorems for systems with different particle numbers in multiple

levels general arguments are supplemented by rigorous considerations for the case of fermions in four landau levels for this case we establish that the zero mode counting can be done by enumerating certain patterns consistent with an underlying epp we apply the coherent state approach to show that the elementary localized bulk excitations are fibonacci anyons this demonstrates that the dna associated with fractional quantum hall states encodes all universal properties specifically for parton like states we establish a link with tensor network structures of finite bond dimension that

together the quantized winding invariant bulk topological string order parameters and a complete solution of the edge modes the physics of these chains is elucidated by studying a complex function determined by the couplings of the hamiltonian in contrast to the short range case where edge modes are associated to roots of this function we find that they are now associated to singularities a remarkable consequence is that the finite size splitting of the edge modes depends on the topological winding number which can be used as a probe of the latter we furthermore generalise these results

version of the orbifold construction the rydberg and ising ladders also possess interesting non invertible symmetries with the spontaneously breaking of one in the former resulting in an unusual ground state degeneracy we give explicit conformal field theory partition functions describing their critical regions and provide a detailed correspondence between lattice and continuum operators in the integrable rydberg blockade ladder\",\"this paper concerns continuous models for two dimensional topological insulators and superconductors such systems are characterized by asymmetric transport along a dimensional curve representing the interface between two insulating materials the asymmetric transport is quantified by an interface conductivity our first objective is to prove that the conductivity is quantized and stable with respect to a large class of perturbations and to relate it to an integral involving the symbol of the systems hamiltonian this is a bulk interface correspondence second we define a modified interface conductivity in a periodic setting and show that it is asymptotically robust despite lacking the topological nature of its infinite domain analogue this periodization allows for numerical evaluations of the conductivity we demonstrate on a class of differential systems that the periodic interface conductivity is a good approximation for the infinite domain conductivity to illustrate the theoretical results we present numerical simulations that approximate the infinite domain conductivity with high accuracy and show that it is approximately quantized even in the presence of perturbations\",\"topological domain walls separating  dimensional topologically ordered phases can be understood in terms of witt equivalences between the umtcs describing anyons in the bulk topological orders however this picture does not provide a framework for decomposing stacks of multiple domain walls into superselection sectors ie into fundamental domain wall types that cannot be mixed by any local operators such a decomposition can be understood using an alternate framework in the case that the topological order is anomaly free in the sense that it can be realized by a commuting projector lattice model by placing these witt equivalences in the context of a category of potentially anomalous d topological orders we develop a framework for computing the decomposition of parallel topological domain walls into indecomposable superselection sectors extending the previous understanding to topological orders with non trivial anomaly we characterize the superselection sectors in terms of domain wall particle mobility which we formalize in terms of tunnelling operators the mathematical model for the category of topological orders is the category of fusion categories enriched over a fixed unitary modular tensor category\",\"non hermitian systems exhibit interesting band structures where novel topological phenomena arise from the existence of exceptional points at which eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce one important open question is how this would manifest at non integer dimension here we report on the appearance of fractal eigenvalue degeneracies and fermi surfaces in hermitian and non hermitian topological band structures this might have profound implications on the physics of black holes and fermi surface instability driven phenomena such as superconductivity and charge density waves\",\"we show that for families of d lattice systems in an invertible phase the cohomology class of the higher berry curvature can be refined to an integral degree class on the parameter space similarly for families of u invariant d lattice systems in an invertible phase the higher thouless pump can be refined to an integral degree class on the parameter space we show that the d thouless pump can be identified with an excess berry curvature of a flux insertion\",\"lowest landau level wavefunctions are eigenstates of the hamiltonian of a charged particle in two dimensions under a uniform magnetic field they are known to be holomorphic both in real and momentum spaces and also exhibit uniform translationally invariant geometrical properties in momentum space in this paper using the stone von neumann theorem we show that lowest landau level wavefunctions are indeed the only possible states with unit chern number satisfying these conditions we also prove the uniqueness of their direct analogs with higher chern numbers and provide their expressions\",\"the subject matter of this work is a d quantum spin chain associated with the inhomogeneous six vertex model possessing an additional symmetry the model is studied in a certain parametric domain where it is critical within the odeiqft approach a class of ordinary differential equations and a quantization condition are proposed which describe the scaling limit of the system some remarkable features of the cft underlying the critical behaviour are observed among them is an infinite degeneracy of the conformal primary states and the presence of a continuous component in the spectrum in the case of even \",\"we employ matrix product states mps and tensor networks to study topological properties of the space of ground states of gapped many body systems we focus on families of states in one spatial dimension where each state can be represented as an injective mps of finite bond dimension such states are short range entangled ground states of gapped local hamiltonians to such parametrized families over we associate a gerbe which generalizes the line bundle of ground states in zero dimensional families emphie in few body quantum mechanics the nontriviality of the gerbe is measured by a class in  which is believed to classify one dimensional parametrized systems we show that when the gerbe is nontrivial there is an obstruction to representing the family of ground states with an mps tensor that is continuous everywhere on  we illustrate our construction with two examples of nontrivial parametrized systems over and  finally we sketch using tensor network methods how the construction extends to higher dimensional parametrized systems with an example of a two dimensional parametrized system that gives rise to a nontrivial gerbe over \",\"we consider the spin  xxx chain weakly perturbed away from integrability by an isotropic next to nearest neighbor exchange interaction recently it was conjectured that this model possesses an infinite tower of quasiconserved integrals of motion charges d kurlov et al phys rev b   in this work we first test this conjecture by investigating how the norm of the adiabatic gauge potential agp scales with the system size which is known to be a remarkably accurate measure of chaos we find that for the perturbed xxx chain the behavior of the agp norm corresponds to neither an integrable nor a chaotic regime which supports the conjectured quasi integrability of the model we then prove the conjecture and explicitly construct the infinite set of quasiconserved charges our proof relies on the fact that the xxx chain perturbed by next to nearest exchange interaction can be viewed as a truncation of an integrable long range deformation of the heisenberg spin chain\",\"we investigate the physical properties of symmetric integrable chains with local degrees of freedom in the fundamental representation given the typical connection between integrability and critical points we test the models properties against a hypothesis of conformal invariant long distance behavior leveraging an embedding between the exceptional lie algebra and symmetric chains with local spin representations we perform numerical analyses via exact diagonalization ed targeted at specific spin sectors as well as via non abelian density matrix renormalization group dmrg a basic study of the momentum resolved ed spectrum suggests the low energy system is effectively described by a wess zumino witten wzw theory but we find challenges in further numerical characterization of conformal data the study and control of the phenomenology of this model may have implications for the development of accessible models for fibonacci anyons\",\"we develop a topological classification of non hermitian effective hamiltonians that depend on momentum and frequency such effective hamiltonians are in one to one correspondence to single particle greens functions of systems that satisfy translational invariance in space and time but may be interacting or open we employ k theory which for the special case of noninteracting systems leads to the well known tenfold way topological classification of insulators and fully gapped superconductors relevant theorems for k groups are reformulated and proven in the more transparent language of hamiltonians instead of vector bundles we obtain symmetry classes for frequency dependent non hermitian hamiltonians satisfying anti unitary symmetries employing dimensional reduction the group structure for all these classes is calculated this classification leads to a group structure with one component from the momentum dependence which corresponds to the non hermitian generalization of topological insulators and superconductors and two additional parts resulting from the frequency dependence these parts describe winding of the effective hamiltonian in the frequency direction and in combined momentum frequency space\",\"we investigate interdomain excitations in composite systems of topological orders separated by gapped domain walls we derive two domain wall verlinde formulae that relate the braiding between interdomain excitations and domain wall quasiparticles to the fusion rules of interdomain excitations and the fusion rules of domain wall quasiparticles we show how to compute such braiding and fusion with explicit non abelian examples and find that the fusion rules of interdomain excitations are generally fractional or irrational by exploring the correspondence between composite systems and anyon condensation we uncover why such fusion rules should be called symmetry fractionalized irrationalized fusion rules our domain wall verlinde formulae generalize the verlinde formula of a single topological order and the defect verlinde formula found in c shen and l y hung phys rev lett   our results may find applications in topological quantum computing topological field theories and conformal field theories\",\"what does it mean for a boundary condition to be symmetric with respect to a non invertible global symmetry we discuss two possible definitions in d on the one hand we call a boundary weakly symmetric if the symmetry defects can terminate topologically on it leading to conserved operators for the hamiltonian on an interval in the open string channel on the other hand we call a boundary strongly symmetric if the corresponding boundary state is an eigenstate of the symmetry operators in the closed string channel these two notions of symmetric boundaries are equivalent for invertible symmetries but bifurcate for non invertible symmetries we discuss the relation to anomalies where we observe that it is sometimes possible to gauge a non invertible symmetry in a generalized sense even though it is incompatible with a trivially gapped phase the analysis of symmetric boundaries further leads to constraints on bulk and boundary renormalization group flows in d we study the action of non invertible condensation defects on the boundaries of gauge theory and several tqfts starting from the dirichlet boundary of free maxwell theory the non invertible symmetries generate infinitely many boundary conditions that are neither dirichlet nor neumann\",\"in lumped element electrical circuit theory the problem of solving maxwells equations in the presence of media is reduced to two sets of equations those addressing the local dynamics of a confined energy density the constitutive equations encapsulating local geometry and dynamics and those that enforce the conservation of charge and energy in a larger scale that we express topologically the kirchhoff equations following a consistent geometrical description we develop a new and systematic way to write the dynamics of general lumped element electrical circuits as first order differential equations derivable from a lagrangian and a rayleigh dissipation function leveraging the faddeev jackiw method we identify and classify all singularities that arise in the search for hamiltonian descriptions of general networks furthermore we provide systematics to solve those singularities which is a key problem in the context of canonical quantization of superconducting circuits the core of our solution relies on the correct identification of the reduced manifold in which the circuit state is expressible eg a mix of flux and charge degrees of freedom including the presence of compact ones we apply the fully programmable method to obtain canonically quantizable hamiltonian descriptions of nonlinear and nonreciprocal circuits which would be cumbersomesingular if pure node flux or loop charge variables are used as a starting configuration space this work unifies diverse existent geometrical pictures of electrical network theory and will prove useful for instance to automatize the computation of exact hamiltonian descriptions of superconducting quantum chips\",\"we consider fixed point models for topological phases of matter formulated as discrete path integrals in the language of tensor networks such zero correlation length models with an exact notion of topological invariance are known in the mathematical community as state sum constructions or lattice topological quantum field theories all of the established ansatzes for fixed point models imply the existence of a gapped boundary as well as a commuting projector hamiltonian thus they fail to capture topological phases without a gapped boundary or commuting projector hamiltonian most notably chiral topological phases in dimensions in this work we present a more general fixed point ansatz not affected by the aforementioned restrictions thus our formalism opens up a possible way forward towards a microscopic fixed point description of chiral phases and we present several strategies that may lead to concrete examples furthermore we argue that our more general ansatz constitutes a universal form of topological fixed point models whereas established ansatzes are universal only for fixed points of phases which admit topological boundaries\",\"both the physics and applications of fermionic symmetry protected topological phases rely heavily on a principle known as bulk boundary correspondence which predicts the emergence of protected boundary localized energy excitations boundary states if the bulk is topologically non trivial current theoretical approaches formulate a bulk boundary correspondence as an equality between a bulk and a boundary topological invariant where the latter is a property of boundary states however such an equality does not offer insight about the stability or the sensitivity of the boundary states to external perturbations to solve this problem we adopt a technique known as the wiener hopf factorization of matrix functions using this technique we first provide an elementary proof of the equality of the bulk and the boundary invariants for one dimensional systems with arbitrary boundary conditions in all altland zirnbauer symmetry classes this equality also applies to quasi one dimensional systems eg junctions formed by bulks belonging to the same symmetry class we then show that only topologically non trivial hamiltonians can host stable zero energy edge modes where stability refers to continuous deformation of zero energy excitations with external perturbations that preserve the symmetries of the class by leveraging the wiener hopf factorization we establish bounds on the sensitivity of such stable zero energy modes to external perturbations our results show that the wiener hopf factorization is a natural tool to investigate bulk boundary correspondence in quasi one dimensional fermionic symmetry protected topological phases our results on the stability and sensitivity of zero modes are especially valuable for applications including majorana based topological quantum computing\",\"walker wang models are fixed point models of topological order in dimensions constructed from a braided fusion category for a modular input category  the model itself is invertible and is believed to be in a trivial topological phase whereas its standard boundary is supposed to represent a dimensional chiral phase in this work we explicitly show triviality of the model by constructing an invertible domain wall to vacuum as well as a disentangling generalized local unitary circuit in the case where is a drinfeld center moreover we show that if we allow for fermionic auxiliary degrees of freedom inside the disentangling domain wall or circuit the model becomes trivial for a larger class of modular fusion categories namely those in the witt classes generated by the ising umtc in the appendices we also discuss general non invertible boundaries of general walker wang models and describe a simple axiomatization of extended tqft in terms of tensors\",\"the deconfined quantum critical point dqcp the enigmatic incarnation of the quantum phase transition beyond the landau ginzburg wilson paradigm of symmetries and their spontaneous breaking has been proposed and actively pursued for more than two decades various d quantum many body lattice models both in spinboson and fermion representations have been tested with the state of the art numerical techniques and field theoretical analyses and yet the conclusion is still controversial experimental realizations of dqcp in the quantum magnet srcubo and superconducting quantum criticality in d material have either shown first order transition or intermediate phase the tension between the lattice scale details and the requirement from continuum limit manifested in the form of the inconsistent critical scaling behavior and violations of generic conformal bootstrap bound has not been resolved here we solve these decades long controversies from the new and fundamental perspective of the quantum entanglement we develop the incremental algorithm to compute the entanglement entropy at a fermionic dqcp with unprecedentedly accurate data and reveal the universal coefficient of the logarithmic correction therein is negative and at odds with positivity requirement of the conformal field theory together with results in other d dqcp lattice models both in fermion and spin systems our discoveries clearly demonstrate the d su antiferromagnet to valence bond solid dqcps are not conformal fixed point and naturally explain the experimental difficulties in finding them this marks the end of the beginning of unambiguous finding of the quantum phase transitions truely beyond the landau ginzburg wilson paradigm since its suggestion two decades ago\",\"we consider a quantum fully packed loop model on the square lattice with a frustration free projector hamiltonian and ring exchange interactions acting on plaquettes a boundary hamiltonian is added to favour domain wall boundary conditions and link ground state properties to the combinatorics and six vertex model literature we discuss how the boundary term fractures the hilbert space into krylov subspaces and we prove that the hamiltonian is ergodic within each subspace leading to a series of energy equidistant exact eigenstates in the lower end of the spectrum among them we systematically classify both finitely entangled eigenstates and product eigenstates using a recursion relation for enumerating half plane configurations we compute numerically the exact entanglement entropy of the ground state confirming area law scaling finally the spectrum is shown to be gapless in the thermodynamic limit with a trial state constructed by adding a twist to the ground state superposition\",\"a parameter family of invertible states gives a topological transport phenomenon similar to the thouless pumping as a natural generalization of this we can consider a family of invertible states parametrized by some topological space  this is called a higher pump it is conjectured that dimensional bosonic invertible state parametrized by is classified by  in this paper we construct two higher pumping models parametrized by and that corresponds to the torsion part of  as a consequence of the nontriviality as a family we find that a quantum mechanical system with a nontrivial discrete berry phase is pumped to the boundary of the dimensional system we also study higher pump phenomena by using matrix product states mps and construct a higher pump invariant which takes value in a torsion part of  this is a higher analog of the ordinary discrete berry phase that takes value in the torsion part of  in order to define the higher pump invariant we utilize the smooth deligne cohomology and its integration theory we confirm that the higher pump invariant of the model has a nontrivial value\",\"tessellations of the hyperbolic spaces by regular polygons are becoming popular because they support discrete quantum and classical models displaying unique spectral and topological characteristics resolving the true bulk spectra and the thermodynamic response functions of these models requires converging periodic boundary conditions and our work delivers a practical solution for this open problem on generic pq tessellations this enables us to identify the true spectral gaps of bulk hamiltonians and as an application we construct all but one topological models that deliver the topological gaps predicted by the k theory of the lattices we demonstrate the emergence of the expected topological spectral flows whenever two such bulk models are deformed into each other and additionally we prove the emergence of topological channels whenever a soft physical interface is created between different topological classes of hamiltonians\",\"particles hopping on a two dimensional hyperbolic lattice feature unconventional energy spectra and wave functions that provide a largely uncharted platform for topological phases of matter beyond the euclidean paradigm using real space topological markers as well as chern numbers defined in the higher dimensional momentum space of hyperbolic band theory we construct and investigate hyperbolic haldane models which are generalizations of haldanes honeycomb lattice model to various hyperbolic lattices we present a general framework to characterize point group symmetries in hyperbolic tight binding models and use this framework to constrain the multiple first and second chern numbers in momentum space we observe several topological gaps characterized by first chern numbers of value and  the momentum space chern numbers respect the predicted symmetry constraints and agree with real space topological markers indicating a direct connection to observables such as the number of chiral edge modes with our large repertoire of models we further demonstrate that the topology of hyperbolic haldane models is trivialized for lattices with strong negative curvature\",\"in topological data analysis tda one often studies the shape of data by constructing a filtered topological space whose structure is then examined using persistent homology however a single filtered space often does not adequately capture the structure of interest in the data and one is led to consider multiparameter persistence which associates to the data a space equipped with a multiparameter filtration multiparameter persistence has become one of the most active areas of research within tda with exciting progress on several fronts in this article we introduce multiparameter persistence and survey some of this recent progress with a focus on ideas likely to lead to practical applications in the near future\",\"we derive exact results for the lindblad equation for a quantum spin chain one dimensional quantum compass model with dephasing noise the system possesses doubly degenerate nonequilibrium steady states due to the presence of a conserved charge commuting with the hamiltonian and lindblad operators we show that the system can be mapped to a non hermitian kitaev model on a two leg ladder which is solvable by representing the spins in terms of majorana fermions this allows us to study the liouvillian gap the inverse of relaxation time in detail we find that the liouvillian gap increases monotonically when the dissipation strength is small while it decreases monotonically for large  implying a kind of phase transition in the first decay mode the liouvillian gap and the transition point are obtained in closed form in the case where the spin chain is critical we also obtain the explicit expression for the autocorrelator of the edge spin the result implies the suppression of decoherence when the spin chain is in the topological regime\",\"we consider a specific instance of a superconducting circuit the so called charge qubit consisting of a capacitor and a josephson junction starting from the microscopic description of the latter in terms of two tunneling bcs models in the strong coupling quasi spin formulation we derive the hamiltonian governing the quantum behavior of the circuit in the limit of a large number of quasi spins our approach relies on the identification of suitable quantum fluctuations ie of collective quasi spin operators which account for the presence of fluctuation operators in the superconducting phase that retain a quantum character in spite of the large limit we show indeed that these collective quantum fluctuations generate the heisenberg algebra on the circle and that their dynamics reproduces the one of the quantized charge qubit without the need of a phenomenological third quantization of a semiclassically inspired model as a byproduct of our derivation we explicitly obtain the temperature dependence of the junction critical josephson current in the strong coupling regime a result which is not directly accessible using standard approximation techniques\",\"we present a rigorous but elementary index theory for a class of one dimensional systems of interacting and possibly disordered fermions with symmetry defined on the infinite chain the class includes the su schrieffer heeger ssh model as a special case for any locally unique gapped fixed charge ground state of a model in the class we define a index in terms of the sign of the expectation value of the local twist operator we prove that the index is topological in the sense that it is invariant under continuous modification of models in the class with a locally unique fixed charge gapped ground state this establishes that any path of models in the class that connects the two extreme cases of the ssh model must go through a phase transition our rigorous classification is believed to be optimal for the class of models considered here we also show an interesting duality of the index and prove that any topologically nontrivial model in the class has a gapless edge excitation above the ground state when defined on the half infinite chain the results extend to other classes of models including the extended hubbard model our strategy to focus on the expectation value of local unitary operators makes the theory intuitive and conceptually simple the paper also contains a careful discussion about the notion of unique gapped ground states of a particle system on the infinite chain\",\"we study two dimensional d droplets of non interacting electrons in a strong magnetic field placed in a confining potential with arbitrary shape using semiclassical methods adapted to the lowest landau level we show that energy eigenstates are localized on level curves of the potential with position dependent local widths and heights this one particle insight allows us to deduce explicit formulas for many body observables in the thermodynamic limit the droplets density falls off at the boundary with an inhomogeneous width inherited from the underlying wave functions the many body current exhibits a gaussian jump at the edge and correlations along the edge are long ranged and inhomogeneous we show that this is consistent with the systems universal low energy description as a free d chiral conformal field theory of edge modes known from earlier results in special geometries here the theory is homogeneous in terms of the canonical angle variable of the potential which follows from a delicate interplay between radial and angular dependencies of the eigenfunctions these results are likely to be observable in solid state systems or quantum simulators of d electron gases with a high degree of control on the confining potential\",\"for a parameterized family of invertible states short range entangled states in dimensions we discuss a generalization of the berry phase using translationally invariant infinite matrix product states mpss we introduce a gerbe structure a higher generalization of complex line bundles as an underlying mathematical structure describing topological properties of a parameterized family of matrix product states we also introduce a triple inner product for three matrix product states which allows us to extract a topological invariant the dixmier douady class over the parameter space\",\"the higher berry curvature was introduced by kapustin and spodyneiko as an extension of the berry curvature in quantum mechanical systems with finite degrees of freedom to quantum many body systems in finite spatial dimensions in this paper we propose an alternative formulation of the higher berry curvature using translationally invariant matrix product states they are the ground states of a set of gapped hamiltonians which are evolved adiabatically through a discretized parameter space because matrix product states transform under a projective representation evaluating the berry curvature on a closed loop through parameter space is not sufficient to fix all the gauge degrees of freedom to obtain a gauge invariant real quantity the higher dimensional berry curvature is evaluated on small tetrahedra in parameter space our numerical calculations confirm that the higher berry curvature varies continuously throughout an adiabatic evolution and becomes quantized over a closed dimensional parameter space\",\"we use cluster expansions to establish local indistiguishability of the finite volume ground states for the aklt model on decorated hexagonal lattices with decoration parameter at least  our estimates imply that the model satisfies local topological quantum order ltqo and so the spectral gap above the ground state is stable against local perturbations\",\"supercapacitors are promising electrochemical energy storage devices due to their prominent performance in rapid chargingdischarging rates long cycle life stability etc experimental measurement and theoretical prediction on charging timescale for supercapacitors often have large difference this work develops a matched asymptotic expansion method to derive the charging dynamics of supercapacitors with porous electrodes in which the supercapacitors are described by the stack electrode model coupling leading order solutions between every two stacks by continuity of ionic concentration and fluxes leads to an ode system which is a generalized equivalent circuit model for zeta potentials with the potential dependent nonlinear capacitance and resistance determined by physical parameters of electrolytes eg specific counterion valences for asymmetric electrolytes linearized stability analysis on the ode system after projection is developed to theoretically characterize the charging timescale the derived asymptotic solutions are numerically verified further numerical investigations on the biexponential charging timescales demonstrate that the proposed generalized equivalent circuit model as well as companion linearized stability analysis can faithfully capture the charging dynamics of symmetricasymmetric electrolytes in supercapacitors with porous electrodes\",\"ferromagnetic ground states have often been overlooked in comparison to seemingly more interesting antiferromagnetic ground states however both the physical and mathematical structure of ferromagnetic ground states are particularly rich we show that the highly degenerate and highly entangled ground states of the ferromagnetic spin biquadratic model are scale invariant originating from spontaneous symmetry breaking from to with two type b goldstone modes the ground state degeneracies are characterized as the fibonacci lucas sequences an ancient mathematical gem under open and periodic boundary conditions with the residual entropy being non zero this implies that the ground state degeneracies for this model are asymptotically the golden spiral in addition sequences of degenerate ground states generated from highest and generalized highest weight states are constructed to establish that the entanglement entropy scales logarithmically with the block size in the thermodynamic limit with the prefactor being half the number of type b goldstone modes the latter in turn is identified to be the fractal dimension\",\"we introduce a family of so symmetric spin chains which generalize the transverse field ising chain for  these spin chains are defined with gamma matrices and can be exactly solved by mapping to species of itinerant majorana fermions coupled to a static gauge field their phase diagrams include a critical point described by the so wess zumino witten model as well as two distinct gapped phases we show that one of the gapped phases is a trivial phase and the other realizes a symmetry protected topological phase when  these two gapped phases are proved to be related to each other by a kramers wannier duality furthermore other elegant structures in the transverse field ising chain such as the infinite dimensional onsager algebra also carry over to our models\",\"levin wen string net models provide a construction of d topologically ordered phases of matter with anyonic localized excitations described by the drinfeld center of a unitary fusion category anyon condensation is a mechanism for phase transitions between d topologically ordered phases we construct an extension of levin wen models in which tuning a parameter implements anyon condensation we also describe the classification of anyons in levin wen models via representation theory of the tube algebra and use a variant of the tube algebra to classify low energy localized excitations in the condensed phase\",\"in this work we show that a critical point of a d self dual boundary phase transition between two gapped boundaries of the topological order can be described by a mathematical structure called an enriched fusion category the critical point of a boundary phase transition can be viewed as a gappable non chiral gapless boundary of the topological order a mathematical theory of the gapless boundaries of d topological orders developed by kong and zheng arxiv and arxiv tells us that all macroscopic observables on the gapless boundary form an enriched unitary fusion category which can be obtained by a holographic principle called the topological wick rotation using this method we obtain the enriched fusion category that describes a critical point of the phase transition between the condensed boundary and the condensed boundary of the topological order to verify this idea we also construct a lattice model to realize the critical point and recover the mathematical data of this enriched fusion category the construction further shows that the categorical symmetry of the boundary is determined by the topological defects in the bulk which indicates the holographic principle indirectly this work shows as a concrete example that the mathematical theory of the gapless boundaries of d topological orders is a powerful tool to study general phase transitions\",\"in a recent paper gorbenko and zan arxiv observed that symmetry alone does not protect the well known renormalization group flow from the dilute to the dense phase of the two dimensional model under thermal perturbations we show in this paper that the required extra protection is topological in nature and is related to the existence of certain non invertible topological

special attention to developing formulas related to the translational elements of the affine weyl groups as applications we show how these are used to clarify the natures of some integrable systems of type and appeared recently in the literature\",\"in this paper we develop certain structural and representation theoretical aspects of abstract generalized weyl algebra and galois algebras the later class of algebras has been introduced by v futorny and s ovsienko and has lead to recent breakthroughs in representation theory from the structure theory side we show how this theory provides a simple criteria to show that certain algebras are not pi algebras then we compare many classes of galois algebras considered recently and show that the gelfand kirillov conjecture is satisfied in a broad situation refining previous work we show that the invariants of a broad class of generalized weyl algebras under the action of complex reflection groups are galois orders finally we consider the lifting of maximal ideals in generalized weyl algebras\",\"the two main approaches to the study of irreducible representations of orders via traces and poisson orders have so far been applied in a completely independent fashion we define and study a natural compatibility relation between the two approaches leading to the notion of poisson trace orders it is proved that all regular and reduced traces are always compatible with any poisson order structure the modified discriminant ideals of all poisson trace orders are proved to be poisson ideals and the zero loci of discriminant ideals are

generalization of two natural but seemingly unrelated embeddings one on the quantum affine schur algebra level and the other on the non quantum level the embedding on the quantum affine schur algebras is used extensively in the analysis of canonical bases of quantum affine and  the embedding on the non quantum level is used crucially in a work of riche and williamson on the study of modular representation theory of general linear groups over a finite field the same embedding is also used in a work of maksimau on the categorical representations of affine general linear algebras we further

formulation for a special class of genus zero curves by kidwai and the author and also improving the proposal by chekhov and eynard along the way we uncover a fundamental geometric structure underlying the hyperelliptic refined topological recursion and investigate its properties parts of which remain conjectural due to computational difficulties moreover we establish a new recursion valid in the so called nekrasov shatashivili limit and prove existence of the corresponding quantum curve\",\"we study symplectic properties of the monodromy map of the schrodinger equation on a riemann surface with a meromorphic potential having second order poles at first we discuss the conditions for the base projective connection which induces its own set of darboux homological

various homology spheres including a hyperbolic manifold using this method\",\"we construct morse bott floer spectral sequences for symplectic c manifolds converging to their symplectic cohomology these are a floer theoretic analogue of the classical morse bott spectral sequence for ordinary cohomology the spectral sequences determine a filtration by ideals on quantum cohomology it yields filtrations by cup product ideals for singular cohomology of any conical symplectic resolution we compute a plethora of explicit examples each highlighting various features for springer resolutions du val resolutions and several slodowy varieties of type a we also consider certain higgs moduli spaces for which we compare our filtration with the well known pw filtration we include a substantial

intersection theory on mixed shimura varieties we first introduce the theory of non pluripolar products on holomorphic vector bundles on complex manifolds then we define and study a special class of singularities of hermitian metrics on vector bundles called good singularities partially extending mumfords notion of good singularities next we derive a chern weil type formula expressing the chern numbers of hermitian vector bundles with good singularities on mixed shimura varieties in terms of the associated b divisors we also define an intersection theory on the riemann zariski space and apply it to reformulate our chern weil formula finally we define and study the okounkov bodies of b divisors\",\"we study series invariants of manifolds defined by gukov pei putrov vafa using techniques from the theory of normal surface singularities such as splice diagrams this provides a link between algebraic geometry with quantum topology we show that the suitably normalized sum of all

fundamental shadow link complement for sufficiently small cone angles together with costantino and thurstons result that all compact oriented manifolds with toroidal or empty boundary can be obtained by doing an integral surgery along some components of a suitable fundamental shadow link this provides a possible approach of solving chen yangs volume conjecture for the reshetikhin turaev invariants of closed oriented hyperbolic manifolds we also introduce a family of topological operations the change of pair operations that connect all pairs of a closed oriented manifold and a framed link inside it that have homeomorphic complements which correspond to doing the partial discrete fourier transforms to the corresponding relative reshetikhin turaev invariants as an application we find a poisson

iqbal neitzke and vafa which provides connections between physics in the form of dimensional reduction of m theory and algebraic geometry in the form of intersection theory on del pezzo surfaces the starting point for that connection to rational homotopy theory is the description of m theory dynamics using the sphere via hypothesis h this progresses to dimensional reduction of m theory on tori with its dynamics described via cyclic loop spaces of the sphere  producing a series of data analogous to that given by the del pezzo surfaces  for  with the mathematical constructions established in the previous paper in this companion physics paper we present novel connections to m theory that enhance the triality including those strengthening the duality this uncovers interesting ties between algebraic geometry algebraic topology and m theory and provides tantalizing links we further expand on the extension of the duality and triality to the kac moody setting\",\"we introduce a two variable refinement of plumbed manifold invariants  which were previously defined for weakly negative definite plumbed manifolds we also provide a number of explicit examples in which we argue the recovering process to obtain from by taking a limit  for plumbed manifolds with two high valency vertices we analytically compute the limit by using the explicit integer solutions of quadratic

inequivalent notions of kodaira type for a singular fiber one associated with its local monodromy and one with its hwang oguiso characteristic cycle when the two kodaira types are not equal the geometry is subtler and its deformation space gets smaller partially frozen singularities the paper analyzes the physical interpretation of the hwang oguiso invariant in the context of d n qft and describes the surprising phenomena which appear when it does not coincide with the monodromy type the hwang oguiso multiple fibers are in one to one correspondence with the partially frozen

parametrized by  resulting in a novel purely analytic proof of gluing formula for analytic torsion in complete generality intriguingly the gluing formula in this article could be reformulated as the bismut zhang theorem for non morse functions and from the perspective of vishiks theory of moving boundary problems the deformation parameter parametrizes a family of boundary conditions our proof also makes use of an interesting connection between small eigenvalues of witten laplacians and mayer vietoris sequences lastly in subsequent work the techniques above are extended to analytic torsion

spectral curve from this perspective\",\"we classify periodic y systems of rank satisfying the symplectic property we find that there are six such y systems in all cases the periodicity follows from the existence of two reddening sequences associated with the time evolution of the y systems in positive and negative directions which gives rise to quantum dilogarithm identities associated with donaldson thomas invariants we also consider series called the nahm sums associated with these y systems we see that they are included in zagiers list of rank nahm sums that are likely to be modular

for instance it is the higher order moment cumulant relation in free probability or can be used to compute intersection numbers on the moduli space of complex curves we derive the laplace transform of this functional relation which has a very nice and compact form as a formal power series in  we apply the laplace transformed formula to the airy curve and the lambert curve\",\"many studies have attempted to give series whose radial limits are quantum invariants in this paper we construct indefinite false theta functions whose radial limits are witten reshetikhin turaev invariants of some plumbed manifolds here zwegers indefinite theta functions are unsuitable since we can prove that its radial limits vanish as a consequence of our main result we also give a new series whose radial

hopf matrix factorization requires solving a scalar riemann hilbert on an elliptic surface and the associated genus jacobi inversion problem solved in terms of the associated riemann function numerical results for the absolute value of the total velocity potentials are reported and discussed\",\"we consider the propagation of the acoustic wave in a periodic medium containing small cavities of arbitrary shape with dirichlet boundary conditions the rigorous approach reveals that there are exceptional wave vectors for which bloch waves are a set of clusters of perturbed plane waves propagating in different directions the leading terms of bloch waves their dispersion relations and the cutoff frequencies are determined it is shown that for those exceptional wave vectors no bloch waves are propagating in one particular direction\",\"dealing with the inverse source problem for the scalar wave equation we have shown recently that we can reconstruct the spacetime dependent source function from the measurement of the wave collected on a single point and a large enough interval of time generated by a small scaled bubble enjoying large contrasts of its bulk modulus injected inside the domain to image here we extend this result to reconstruct not only the source function but also the variable wave speed indeed from the measured waves we first localize the internal values of the travel time function by looking at the behavior of this collected wave in terms of time then from the eikonal equation we recover the wave speed second we recover the internal values of the wave generated only by the background in the absence of the small particles from the same measured data by inverting a volterra integral operator of the second kind from this reconstructed wave we recover the source function at the expense of a numerical differentiation\",\"we study streaking artifacts caused by beam hardening effects in x ray computed tomography ct the effect is known to be nonlinear we show that the nonlinearity can be recovered from the observed artifacts for strictly convex bodies the result provides a theoretical support for removal of the artifacts\",\"this paper is concerned with an inverse transmission problem for recovering the shape of a penetrable rectangular grating sitting on a perfectly conducting plate we consider a general transmission problem with the coefficient lambdaneq which covers the tm polarization case it is proved that a rectangular grating profile can be uniquely determined by the near field observation data incited by a single plane wave and measured on a line segment above the grating in comparision with the te case lambda the wave field cannot lie in h around each corner point bringing essential difficulties in proving uniqueness with one plane wave our approach relies on singularity analysis for helmholtz transmission problems in a right corner domain and also provides an alternative idea for treating the te transmission conditions which were considered in the authors previous work inverse problem  \",\"in this paper we propose a frequency domain method for recovering the trajectory of a moving point source from multi frequency near field data measured at one and sparse observation points in three dimensions the radiating period of the moving point source is supposed to be supported on the real axis and a priori known in contrast to inverse stationary source problems one needs to study observable and non observable measurement positions the analogue of these concepts in the far field regime were firstly proposed in the authors previous paper to appear in siam j imaging sciences  in this paper the observable and non observable measurement positions for straight and circular motions are analyzed in the near field case we verify that the smallest annular region that contains the trajectory and centered at an observable position can be imaged for an admissible class of orbit functions using the data from sparse observable positions it is possible to reconstruct the convex domain of the trajectory intensive d numerical tests with synthetic data are performed to show effectiveness and feasibility of this new algorithm\",\"we put forward a simple but effective explicit method of recovering initial data for the nonlinear shallow water system from the reading at the shoreline we then apply our method to the tsunami waves inverse problem\",\"in this paper we deal with the differential properties of the scalar flux defined over a two dimensional bounded convex domain as a solution to the integral radiation transfer equation estimates for the derivatives of the scalar flux near the boundary of the domain are given based on vainikkos regularity theorem a numerical example is presented to demonstrate the implication of the solution smoothness on the convergence behavior of the diamond difference method\",\"we consider the inverse problem of fitting atmospheric dispersion parameters based on time resolved back scattered differential absorption lidar dial measurements the obvious advantage of light based remote sensing modalities is their extended spatial range which makes them less sensitive to strictly local perturbationsmodelling errors or the distance to the plume source in contrast to other state of the art dial methods we do not make a single scattering assumption but rather propose a new type modality which includes the collection of multiply scattered photons from widermultiple fields of view and argue that this data paired with a time dependent radiative transfer model is beneficial for the reconstruction of certain image features the resulting inverse problem is solved by means of a semi parametric approach in which the image is reduced to a small number of dispersion related parameters and high dimensional but computationally convenient nuisance component this not only allows us to effectively avoid a high dimensional inverse problem but simultaneously provides a natural regularisation mechanism along with parameters which are directly related to the dispersion model these can be associated with meaningful physical units while spatial concentration profiles can be obtained by means of forward evaluation of the dispersion process\",\"we consider the inverse medium scattering of reconstructing the medium contrast using born data including the full aperture limited aperture and multi frequency data we propose a class of data driven basis for these inverse problems based on the generalized prolate spheroidal wave functions and related eigenfunctions such data driven eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of a fourier integral operator they remarkably extend analytically to the whole space are doubly orthogonal and are complete in the class of band limited functions we first establish a picard criterion for reconstructing the contrast using the data driven basis where the reconstruction formula can also be understood in the viewpoint of data processing and analytic extrapolation another salient feature associated with the generalized prolate spheroidal wave functions is that the data driven basis for a disk is also a basis for a sturm liouville differential operator with the help of sturm liouville theory we estimate the approximation error for a spectral cutoff approximation of functions  this yields a spectral cutoff regularization strategy for noisy data and an explicit stability estimate for contrast in  in the full aperture case in the limited aperture and multi frequency cases we also obtain spectral cutoff regularization strategies for noisy data and stability estimates for a class of contrast\",\"this paper concerns the analysis of a passive broadband approximate cloaking scheme for the helmholtz equation in for or  using ideas from transformation optics we construct an approximate cloak by blowing up a small ball of radius to one of radius  in the anisotropic cloaking layer resulting from the blow up change of variables we incorporate a drude lorentz type model for the index of refraction and we assume that the cloaked object is a soft perfectly conducting obstacle we first show that for any fixed  there are no real transmission eigenvalues associated with the inhomogeneity representing the cloak which implies that the cloaking devices we have created will not yield perfect cloaking at any frequency even for a single incident time harmonic wave secondly we establish estimates on the scattered field due to an arbitrary time harmonic incident wave these estimates show that as approaches  the norm of the scattered field outside the cloak and its far field pattern approach uniformly over any bounded band of frequencies in other words our scheme leads to broadband approximate cloaking for arbitrary incident time harmonic waves\",\"we analyze an approximate interior transmission eigenvalue problem in for or  motivated by the transmission problem of a transformation optics based cloaking scheme and obtained by replacing the refractive index with its first order approximation which is an unbounded function we show the discreteness of transmission eigenvalues in the complex plane moreover using the radial symmetry we show the existence of infinitely many complex transmission eigenvalues and prove that there exists a horizontal strip in the complex plane around the real axis that does not contain any transmission eigenvalues\",\"suppose that a plane wave is incident onto an impenetrable grating profile of dirichlet or impedance type or a penetrable grating the grating interface is assumed to be given by a lipschitz function in two dimensions we derive stability estimate of the grating diffraction problem via variational method with an explicit dependence of solutions on the incident wavenumber and incident angle\",\"currently theory of ray transforms of vector and tensor fields is well developed but the radon transforms of such fields have not been fully analyzed we thus consider linearly weighted and unweighted longitudinal and transversal radon transforms of vector fields as usual we use the standard helmholtz decomposition of smooth and fast decreasing vector fields over the whole space we show that such a decomposition produces potential and solenoidal components decreasing at infinity fast enough to guarantee the existence of the unweighted longitudinal and transversal radon transforms of these components it is known that reconstruction of an arbitrary vector field from only longitudinal or only transversal transforms is impossible however for the cases when both linearly weighted and unweighted transforms of either one of the types are known we derive explicit inversion formulas for the full reconstruction of the field our interest in the inversion of such transforms stems from a certain inverse problem arising in magnetoacoustoelectric tomography maet the connection between the weighted radon transforms and maet is exhibited in the paper finally we demonstrate performance and noise sensitivity of the new inversion formulas in numerical simulations\",\"we introduce a layer potential representation for the solution of the transmission problem defined by two dielectric channels or open waveguides meeting along the straight line interface the main observation is that the outgoing fundamental solution for the operator acting on functions defined in is easily constructed using the fourier transform in the variable and the elementary theory of ordinary differential equations these fundamental solutions can then be used to represent the solution to the transmission problem in half planes the transmission boundary conditions lead to integral equations along the intersection of the half planes which in our normalization is the axis we show that in appropriate banach spaces these integral equations are fredholm equations of second kind which are therefore generically solvable we then show that the solutions satisfy an analogue of the sommerfeld radiation condition that follows from work of isozaki melrose vasy et al this formulation suggests practicable numerical methods to approximately solve this class of problems\",\"dispersion relation reflects the dependence of wave frequency on its wave vector when the wave passes through certain material it demonstrates the properties of this material and thus it is critical however dispersion relation reconstruction is very time consuming and expensive to address this bottleneck we propose in this paper an efficient dispersion relation reconstruction scheme based on global polynomial interpolation for the approximation of d photonic band functions our method relies on the fact that the band functions are piecewise analytic with respect to the wave vector in the first brillouin zone we utilize suitable sampling points in the first brillouin zone at which we solve the eigenvalue problem involved in the band function calculation and then employ lagrange interpolation to approximate the band functions on the whole first brillouin zone numerical results show that our proposed methods can significantly improve the computational efficiency\",\"in this paper we will derive an integral equation which transform a three dimensional acoustic transmission problem with textitvariable coefficients non zero absorption and mixed boundary conditions to a non local equation on the skeleton of the domain  where skeleton stands for the union of the interfaces and boundaries of a lipschitz partition of  to that end we introduce and analyze abstract layer potentials as solutions of auxiliary coercive full space variational problems and derive jump conditions across domain interfaces this allows us to formulate the non local skeleton equation as a textitdirect method for the unknown cauchy data of the original partial differential equation we establish coercivity and continuity of the variational form of the skeleton equation without based on an auxiliary full space variational problem explicit knowledge of greens functions is not required and our estimates are explicit in the complex wave number\",\"in this paper we prove the existence of a bound state in a waveguide that consists of two semi infinite periodic structures separated by an interface the two periodic structures are perturbed from the same periodic medium with a dirac point and they possess a common band gap enclosing the dirac point the bound state which is called interface mode here decays exponentially away from the interface with a frequency located in the common band gap and can be viewed as a bifurcation from the dirac point using the layer potential technique and asymptotic analysis we first characterize the band gap opening for the two perturbed periodic media and derive the asymptotics of the bloch modes near the band gap edges by formulating the eigenvalue problem for the waveguide with two semi infinite structures using a boundary integral equation over the interface and analyzing the characteristic values of the associated boundary integral operator we prove the existence of the interface mode for the waveguide when the perturbation of the periodic medium is small\",\"the cauchy relations from linear elasticity are treated in this paper in a form that is invariant under two groups of transformations indices permutation and general linear transformations of the basis the irreducible decomposition induced by the permutation group is outlined the cauchy relations are then formulated as a requirement of nullification of an invariant subspace a successive decomposition under rotation group allows to define the partial cauchy relations and two types of elastic materials we explore several applications of the full and partial cauchy relations in physics of materials the structures deviation from the basic physical assumptions of cauchys model is defined in an invariant form the cauchy and non cauchy contributions to hookes law and elasticity energy are explained we identify wave velocities and polarization vectors that are independent of the non cauchy part for acoustic wave propagation several bounds are derived for the elasticity invariant parameters\",\"we establish sharp stability estimates of logarithmic type in determining an impedance obstacle in  the obstacle is of general polygonal shape and the impedance parameter can be variable we establish the stability results by using a single far field pattern which constitutes a longstanding problem in the inverse scattering theory this is the first stability result in the literature in determining an impedance obstacle by a single far field measurement if the obstacle is of a generally polygonal shape the stability in determining the obstacle is established in terms of a modified hausdorff distance and is independent of the boundary impedance parameter if the obstacle is further known to be convex the stability in simultaneously determining the obstacle and the boundary impedance is established in terms of the classical hausdorff distance there are several technical novelties and development in the mathematical strategy developed for establishing the aforementioned stability results first the stability analysis is conducted around a corner point in a micro local manner second our stability estimates establish explicit relationships among the geometric configurations of the obstacle and the vanishing order of the wave field at the corner point third we develop novel error propagation techniques to tackle singularities of the wave field at a corner as well as to tackle the impedance boundary condition\",\"we propose a scheme for imaging periodic surfaces using a superlens by employing an inverse scattering model and the transformed field expansion method we derive an approximate reconstruction formula for the surface profile assuming small amplitude this formula suggests that unlimited resolution can be achieved for the linearized inverse problem with perfectly matched parameters our method requires only a single incident wave at a fixed frequency and can be efficiently implemented using fast fourier transform through numerical experiments we demonstrate that our method achieves resolution significantly surpassing the resolution limit for both smooth and non smooth surface profiles with either perfect or marginally imperfect parameters\",\"the rainbow trapping phenomenon of graded metamaterials can be combined with the fractal spectra of quasiperiodic waveguides to give a metamaterial that performs fractal rainbow trapping this is achieved through a graded cut and project algorithm that yields a projected geometry for which the effective projection angle is graded along its length as a result the fractal structure of local band gaps varies with position leading to broadband fractal rainbow trapping we demonstrate this principle by designing an acoustic waveguide which is characterised using theory simulation and experiments\",\"the transmission eigenvalue problem is a type of non elliptic and non selfadjoint spectral problem that arises in the wave scattering theory when invisibilitytransparency occurs the transmission eigenfunctions are the interior resonant modes inside the scattering medium we are concerned with the geometric rigidity of the transmission eigenfunctions and show that they concentrate on the boundary surface of the underlying domain in two senses this substantiates the recent numerical discovery in  on such an intriguing spectral phenomenon of the transmission resonance our argument is based on generalized weyls law and certain novel ergodic properties of the coupled boundary layer potential operators which are employed to analyze the generalized transmission eigenfunctions\",\"we study the fixed angle inverse scattering problem of determining a sound speed from scattering measurements corresponding to a single incident wave the main result shows that a sound speed close to constant can be stably determined by just one measurement our method is based on studying the linearized problem which turns out to be related to the acoustic problem in photoacoustic imaging we adapt the modified time reversal method from p stefanov and g uhlmann thermoacoustic tomography with variable sound speed inverse problems   to solve the linearized problem in a stable way and we use this to give a local uniqueness result for the nonlinear inverse problem\",\"this paper considers the westervelt equation one of the most widely used models in nonlinear acoustics and seeks to recover two spatially dependent parameters of physical importance from time trace boundary measurements specifically these are the nonlinearity parameter often referred to as in the acoustics literature and the wave speed  the determination of the spatial change in these quantities can be used as a means of imaging we consider identifiability from one or two boundary measurements as relevant in these applications for a reformulation of the problem in terms of the squared slowness and the combined coefficient we devise a frozen newton method and prove its convergence the effectiveness and limitations of this iterative scheme are demonstrated by numerical examples\",\"we propose a numerical method to spline interpolate discrete signals and then apply the integral transforms to the corresponding analytical spline functions this represents a robust and

laplace transform of analytic functions and demonstrate empirical results validating the algorithmic performance using observed and simulated data we also introduce a generalization of the laplace transform in higher dimensional space time we tested the discrete lt algorithm on data sampled from analytic functions with known exact laplace transforms the validation of the discrete ilt involves using complex functions with known analytic ilts\",\"in this paper we extend the rom based approach for inverse scattering with neumann boundary conditions introduced by druskin at al inverse problems

orthogonalization lo step furthermore we present a detailed numerical study and comparison of the accuracy and stability of the da and lo methods\",\"we propose a reconstruction method to extract the variable mass density from the elastic far fields with a single incident direction measured before and after injecting highly dense small scaled inclusions we take as a model the lame system where the mass density is the unknown and the lame parameters are kept as known constants the injected smalldense inclusion with as its location as its maximum radius and of unit volume generates a sequences of resonant frequencies these special frequencies are related to the eigenvalues of the lame volume integral operator defined on the domain of the inclusion therefore these resonant frequencies are in principle computable after injecting the small inclusion at a location point  we send an elastic incident plane wave at an incident frequency close to one of the mentioned resonant frequencies say  contrasting the farfields generated at one incident direction before and after injecting this small inclusion we provide an explicit formula that allows us to recover the quantity where is the greens tensor of the medium in the absence of the inclusion and are the eigenfunctions corresponding to the chosen eigenvalue which is not necessarily a simple eigenvalue of the lame volume integral operator stated on the scaled domain  here is outside of the domain of interest and  then we repeat the experiment by moving the inclusions location inside  finally using this reconstructed field in the lame pde system via a numerical differentiation we recover the values of the mass density inside \",\"we are concerned with a coupled physics spectral problem arising in the coupled propagation of acoustic

coordinate coupled to grassmann valued fermionic coordinates or to a topological wess zumino term these systems decompose into sectors with a classical potential plus a quantum deformation using exact wkb we derive exact quantization condition and its median resummation the solution of median resummed form gives physical borel ecalle resummed results as we show explicitly in quantum deformed double and triple well potentials despite the fact that instantons are finite action for generic quantum deformation they do not contribute to the energy spectrum at leading order in semi classics for certain quantized quantum deformations where the alignment of levels to all order in perturbation theory occurs instantons contribute to the spectrum if deformation parameter is not properly quantized their effect disappears but higher order effects in semi classics survive in this sense we classify saddle contributions as fading and robust finally for quantum deformed triple well potential we demonstrate the p np relation by computing period integrals and mellin transform\",\"integrable sln spin chains which we consider in this paper are not only the prototypical example of quantum integrable systems but also systems with a wide range of applications for these models we use the functional separation of variables fsov technique with a new tool called character projection to compute all matrix elements of a complete set of operators which we call principal operators in the basis diagonalising the tower of conserved charges as determinants in q functions building up on these results we then derive similar determinant forms for the form factors of combinations of multiple principal operators between arbitrary factorizable states which include in particular off shell bethe vectors and bethe vectors with arbitrary twists we prove that the set of principal operators generates the complete spin chain yangian furthermore we derive the representation of these operators in the sov bases allowing one to compute correlation functions with an arbitrary number of principal operators finally we show that the available combinations of multiple insertions includes sklyanins sov b operator as a result we are able to derive the b operator for sln spin chains using a minimal set of ingredients namely the fsov method and the structure of the sov basis\",\"the quantum rabi model qrm one of the fundamental models used to describe light and matter interaction has a deep mathematical structure revealed by the study of its spectrum in this paper directly from the explicit formulas for the partition function we derive various limits of the spectral zeta function with respect to the systems parameters of the asymmetric quantum rabi model aqrm a generalization obtained by adding a physically significant parameter to the qrm in particular we consider the limit corresponding to the growth of the coupling strength to infinity recently studied by fumio hiroshima using resolvent analysis the limits obtained in this paper are given in terms of the hurwitz zeta function and other functions suggesting further relations between spectral zeta function of quantum interaction models and number theory\",\"the star triangle relation plays an important role in the realm of exactly solvable models offering exact results for classical two dimensional statistical mechanical models in this article we construct integrable quantum circuits using the star triangle relation our construction relies on families of mutually commuting two parameter transfer matrices for statistical mechanical models solved by the star triangle relation and differs from previously known constructions based on yang baxter integrable vertex models at special value of the spectral parameter the transfer matrices are mapped into integrable quantum circuits for which infinite families of local conserved charges can be derived we demonstrate the construction by giving two examples of circuits acting on a chain of state qudits state potts circuits whose integrability has been conjectured recently by lotkov et al and circuits which are novel to our knowledge in the first example we present for a connection to the zamolodchikov fateev vertex model\",\"a non hermitian generalisation of the marsden weinstein reduction method is introduced to construct families of quantum symmetric superintegrable models over an dimensional sphere  the mechanism is illustrated with one and two dimensional examples related to and lie algebras respectively providing new quantum models with real spectra and spontaneous symmetric breaking in certain limits the models reduce to known non hermitian systems and complex extensions of previously studied real superintegrable systems\",\"the two dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator is modified with reflection terms associated with the action of the coxeter group  which is the symmetry group of the square the angular momentum operator is also modified with reflections the wavefunctions are known to be built up from jacobi and laguerre polynomials this paper introduces a fourth order differential difference operator commuting with the hamiltonian but not with the angular momentum operator a specific instance of superintegrability the action of the operator on the usual orthogonal basis of wavefunctions is explicitly described the wavefunctions are classified according to the representations of the group four of degree one and one of degree two the identity representation encompasses the wavefunctions invariant under the group the paper begins with a short discussion of the modified hamiltonians associated to finite reflection groups and related raising and lowering operators in particular the hamiltonian for the symmetric groups describes the calogero sutherland model of identical particles on the line with harmonic confinement\",\"the free energy per lattice site of a quantum spin chain in the thermodynamic limit is determined by a single dominant eigenvalue of an associated quantum transfer matrix in the infinite trotter number limit for integrable quantum spin chains related with solutions of the yang baxter equation an appropriate choice of the quantum transfer matrix enables to study its spectrum eg by means of the algebraic bethe ansatz in its turn the knowledge of the full spectrum allows one to study its universality properties such as the appearance of a conformal spectrum in the low temperature regime more generally accessing the full spectrum is a necessary step for deriving thermal form factor series representations of the correlation functions of local operators for the spin chain under consideration these are statements that have been established by physicists on a heuristic level and that are calling for a rigorous mathematical justification in this work we implement certain aspects of this programme with the example of the xxz quantum spin chain in the antiferromagnetic massless regime and in the low temperature limit we rigorously establish the existence and characterise the form of the solutions to the non linear integral equations that are equivalent to the bethe ansatz equations for the quantum transfer matrix of this model this allows us to describe that part of the quantum transfer matrix spectrum that is related to the bethe ansatz and that does not collapse to zero in the infinite trotter number limit within the considered part of the spectrum we rigorously identify the dominant eigenvalue and show that those correlations lengths that diverge in the low temperature limit are given to the leading order by the spectrum of the free boson conformal field theory this rigorously establishes a long standing conjecture present in the physics literature\",\"the super jack polynomials introduced by kerov okounkov and olshanski are polynomials in variables which reduce to the jack polynomials when or and

form of the form  with quantum integrals of the rational deformed calogero moser sutherland system in addition we provide a new proof of the lassalle nekrasov correspondence between trigonometric and rational harmonic deformed calogero moser sutherland systems and infer orthogonality of super hermite polynomials which provide joint eigenfunctions of the latter system\",\"with the help of the generalized peres horodecki separability criterion simons condition for a bipartite gaussian state we have studied the separability of the noncommutative space ncs coordinate degrees of freedom non symplectic nature of the transformation between the usual commutative space and ncs restricts the straightforward use of simons condition in ncs we have transformed the ncs system to an equivalent hamiltonian in commutative space through the bopp shift which enables the utilization of the separability criterion to make our study fairly general and to analyze the effect of parameters on the separability of bipartite state in nc space we have considered a bilinear hamiltonian with time dependent td parameters along with a td external interaction which is linear in field modes the system is transformed  into canonical form keeping the intrinsic symplectic structure intact the solution of the td schrodinger equation is obtained with the help of the lewis riesenfeld invariant method lrim expectation values of the observables thus the covariance matrix  are constructed from the states obtained from lrim it turns out that the existence of the anisotropy in the oscillator determines the separability of the states in particular for an isotropic oscillator the bipartite states are always separable whereas particular anisotropic parameter values may cease the separability thus tuning the parameter values one can destroy or recreate the separability of states with the help of a toy model we have demonstrated how the tuning of a td ncs parameter affects the separability\",\"in this note we study some classical aspects of supersymmetric oscillators in one and two spatial bosonic dimensions our main ingredient is a generalized poisson bracket which emerges as a classical counterpart to commutators and anticommutators from supersymmetric quantum mechanics in one dimension ie in presence of one bosonic and one fermionic coordinate the hamiltonian admits a symmetry for which we explicitly compute the first integrals it is found that the supercharges emerge from the formalism in a natural way as fermionic conserved quantities following this we describe classical supercharge operators based on the generalized poisson bracket which define supersymmetry transformations the results are generalized to two spatial dimensions where there is a symmetry in

said biorthogonality has been variously understood in terms of time reversal operator and clifford involutions the possibility of an equivalent version of kramers degeneracy theorem has been explored and the super symmetric and pseudo super symmetric structures relating to the present system are also discussed\",\"we describe integrable elliptic q deformed anisotropic long range spin chain the derivation is based on our recent construction for commuting anisotropic elliptic spin ruijsenaars macdonald operators we prove that the polychronakos freezing trick can be applied to these operators thus providing the commuting set of hamiltonians for long range spin chain constructed by means of the elliptic baxter belavin matrix namely we show that the freezing trick is reduced to a set of elliptic function identities which are then proved these identities can be treated as conditions for equilibrium position in the underlying classical spinless ruijsenaars schneider model trigonometric

transformation theory between the hermite and non hermite systems as an example of application we show a specific description of our rigged hilbert space treatment for some parity time symmetrical quantum systems\",\"we discuss the systems the functional form of the bethe ansatz equations for the twisted gaudin model from a new geometric point of view we use a concept of wronskians which are certain meromorphic sections of principal bundles on the projective line in this context the system similar to its difference analog is realized as the relation between generalized minors of the wronskian we explain the link between wronskians and twisted oper connections which are the traditional source for the systems\",\"integrability of the one dimensional hubbard model and of the factorised scattering problem encountered on the worldsheet of ads strings can be expressed in terms of a peculiar quantum algebra in this article we derive the classical limit of these algebraic integrable structures based on established results for the exceptional simple lie superalgebra depsilon along with standard sl which form supersymmetric isometries on d ads space the two major steps in this construction consist in the contraction to a d poincare superalgebra and a certain reduction to a deformation of the u superalgebra we apply these steps to the integrable structure and obtain the desired lie bialgebras with suitable classical r matrices of rational and trigonometric kind we illustrate our findings in terms of representations for on shell fields on ads and flat space\",\"we study the bethe ansatz equations for the quantum kdv model which are also known to be solved by the spectral determinants of a specific family of anharmonic oscillators called monster potentials odeim correspondence these bethe ansatz equations depend on two parameters identified with the momentum and the degree at infinity of the anharmonic oscillators we provide a complete classification of the solutions with only real and positive roots when the degree is greater than in terms of admissible sequences of holes in particular we prove that admissible sequences of holes are naturally parameterised by integer partitions and we prove that they are in one to one correspondence with solutions of the bethe ansatz equations if the momentum is large enough consequently we deduce that the monster potentials are complete in the sense that every solution of the bethe ansatz equations coincides with the spectrum of a unique monster potential this essentially ie up to gaps in the previous literature proves the odeim correspondence for the quantum kdv modelmonster potentials which was conjectured by dorey tateo and bazhanov lukyanov zamolodchikov when the degree is greater than  our

action angle variables as a natural component of the classical sysmmetries within this formalism\",\"taking the hydrogen atom as an example it is shown that if the symmetry of a three dimensional system is  the variables allow a separation of the variable  and the eigenfunctions define a new family of orthogonal polynomials in two variables  these polynomials are related to the finite

review the fundamental properties of the quantum relative entropy for finite dimensional hilbert spaces in particular we focus on several inequalities that are related to the second law of thermodynamics where the positivity and the monotonicity of the quantum relative entropy play key roles these properties are directly applicable to derivations of the second law eg the clausius inequality moreover the positivity is closely related to the quantum fluctuation theorem while the monotonicity leads to a quantum version of the hatano sasa inequality for nonequilibrium steady states based on the monotonicity we also discuss the data processing inequality for the quantum mutual information which has a similar mathematical structure to that of the second law moreover we derive a generalized second law with quantum feedback control in addition we review a proof of the monotonicity in line with petz\",\"recently the hilbert schmidt speed as a special class of quantum statistical speed has been reported to improve the interferometric phase in single parameter quantum estimation here we test this concept in the multiparameter scenario where two laser phases are estimated in a theoretical model consisting of a three level atom interacting with two classical monochromatic fields when the atom is initially prepared in the lower bare state taking into account the detuning parameters we extract an exact analytical solution of the atomic density matrix in the case of two photon resonant transition further we compare the performance of laser phase parameters estimation in individual and simultaneous metrological strategies and we explore the role of quantum coherence in improving the efficiency of unknown multi phase shift estimation protocols the obtained results show that the hilbert schmidt speed detects the lower bound on the statistical estimation error as well as the optimal estimation regions where its maximal corresponds to the maximal quantum fisher information the performance of simultaneous multiparameter estimation with individual estimation inevitably depends on the detuning parameters of the three level atom and not only the quantum entanglement but also the quantum coherence is a crucial resource to improve the accuracy of a metrological protocol\",\"when simulating the time evolution of quantum many body systems on a digital quantum computer one faces the challenges of quantum noise and of the trotter error due to time discretization the trotter error in integrable spin chains can be under control if the discrete time evolution preserves integrability in this work we implement on a real quantum computer and on classical simulators the integrable trotterization of the spin  heisenberg xxx spin chain we study how quantum noise affects the time evolution of several conserved charges and observe the decay of the expectation values we in addition study the early time behaviors of the time evolution which can potentially be used to benchmark quantum devices and algorithms in the future we also provide an efficient method to generate the conserved charges at higher orders\",\"observational entropy provides a general notion of quantum entropy that appropriately interpolates between boltzmanns and gibbs entropies and has recently been argued to provide a useful measure of out of equilibrium thermodynamic entropy here we study the mathematical properties of observational entropy from an information theoretic viewpoint making use of recently strengthened forms of the monotonicity property of quantum relative entropy we present new bounds on observational entropy applying in general as well as bounds and identities related to sequential and post processed measurements a central role in this work is played by what we call the coarse grained state which emerges from the measurements statistics by bayesian retrodiction without presuming any knowledge about the true underlying state being measured the degree of distinguishability between such a coarse grained state and the true but generally unobservable one is shown to provide upper and lower bounds on the difference between observational and von neumann entropies\",\"we study whether one can write a matrix product density operator mpdo as the gibbs state of a quasi local parent hamiltonian we conjecture this is the case for generic mpdo and give supporting evidences to investigate the locality of the parent hamiltonian we take the approach of checking whether the quantum conditional mutual information decays exponentially the mpdo we consider are constructed from a chain of input output y shaped completely positive maps ie the mpdo have a local purification we derive an upper bound on the conditional mutual information for bistochastic channels and strictly positive channels and show that it decays exponentially if the correctable algebra of the channel is trivial we also introduce a conjecture on a quantum data processing inequality that implies the exponential decay of the conditional mutual information for every y shaped channel with trivial correctable algebra we additionally investigate a close but nonequivalent cousin mpdo measured in a local basis we provide sufficient conditions for the exponential decay of the conditional mutual information of the measured states and numerically confirm they are generically true for certain random mpdo\",\"we study the use of von neumann entropy constraints for obtaining lower bounds on the ground energy of quantum many body systems known methods for obtaining certificates on the ground energy typically use consistency of local observables and are expressed as semidefinite programming relaxations the local marginals defined by such a relaxation do not necessarily satisfy entropy inequalities that follow from the existence of a global state here we propose to add such entropy constraints that lead to tighter convex relaxations for the ground energy problem we give analytical and numerical results illustrating the advantages of such entropy constraints we also show limitations of the entropy constraints we construct they are implied by doubling the number of sites in the relaxation and as a result they can at best lead to a quadratic improvement in terms of the matrix sizes of the variables we explain the relation to a method for approximating the free energy known as the markov entropy decomposition method\",\"systems in thermal equilibrium at non zero temperature are described by their gibbs state for classical many body systems the metropolis hastings algorithm gives a markov process with a local update rule that samples from the gibbs distribution for quantum systems sampling from the gibbs state is significantly more challenging many algorithms have been proposed but these are more complex than the simple local update rule of classical metropolis sampling requiring non trivial quantum algorithms such as phase estimation as a subroutine here we show that a dissipative quantum algorithm with a simple local update rule is able to sample from the quantum gibbs state in contrast to the classical case the quantum gibbs state is not generated by converging to the fixed point of a markov process but by the states generated at the stopping time of a conditionally stopped process this gives a new answer to the long sought after quantum analogue of metropolis sampling compared to previous quantum gibbs sampling algorithms the local update rule of the process has a simple implementation which may make it more amenable to near term implementation on suitable quantum hardware this dissipative gibbs sampler works for arbitrary quantum hamiltonians without any assumptions on or knowledge of its properties and comes with certifiable precision and run time bounds\",\"entropy is a fundamental concept in quantum information theory that allows to quantify entanglement and investigate its properties for example its monogamy over multipartite systems here we derive variational formulas for relative entropies based on restricted measurements of multipartite quantum systems by combining these with multivariate matrix trace inequalities we recover and sometimes strengthen various existing entanglement monogamy inequalities in particular we give direct matrix analysis based proofs for the faithfulness of squashed entanglement by relating it to the relative entropy of entanglement measured with one way local operations and classical communication as well as for the faithfulness of conditional entanglement of mutual information by relating it to the separably measured relative entropy of entanglement we discuss variations of these results using the relative entropy to states with positive partial transpose and multipartite setups our results simplify and generalize previous derivations in the literature that employed operational arguments about the asymptotic achievability of information theoretic tasks\",\"we establish a connection between the relative classical entropy and the relative fermi dirac entropy allowing to transpose in the context of the boltzmann or landau equation any entropy entropy production inequality from one case to the other therefore providing entropy entropy production inequalities for the boltzmann fermi dirac operator similar to the ones of the classical boltzmann operator we also provide a generalized version of the csiszar kullback pinsker inequality to weighted lp norms p and a wide class of entropies\",\"nature is governed by precise physical laws which can inspire the discovery of new computer run simulation algorithms thermal states are the most ubiquitous for they are the equilibrium states of matter simulating thermal states of quantum matter has applications ranging from quantum machine learning to better understanding of high temperature superconductivity and quantum chemistry the computational complexity of this task is hopelessly hard for classical computers the existing quantum algorithms come with caveats most either require quantum phase estimation rendering them impractical for current noisy hardware or are variational which face obstacles such as initialization barren plateaus and a general lack of provable guarantee we provide two quantum algorithms with provable guarantees to prepare thermal states on near term quantum computers that avoid these drawbacks the first algorithm is inspired by the natural thermalization process where the ancilla qubits act as the infinite thermal bath this algorithm can potentially run in polynomial time to sample thermal distributions of ergodic systems the vast class of physical systems that equilibrate in isolation with respect to local observables the second algorithm works for any system and in general runs in exponential time however it requires significantly smaller quantum resources than previous such algorithms in addition we provide an error mitigation technique for both algorithms to fight back decoherence which enables us to run our algorithms on the near term quantum devices to illustration we simulate the thermal state of the hardcore bose hubbard model on the latest generation of available quantum computers\",\"in this paper we introduce a one parameter generalization of the famous bottcher wenzel bw inequality in terms of a deformed commutator for matrices and  we consider the inequality  relanglebabaqrangle le cq a b  where is the hilbert schmidt inner product is the frobenius norm is the commutator and is the deformed commutator we prove that when  or when is normal with any size  the optimal bound is given by  cq  fracq sqrtq  we conjecture that this is also true for any matrices and this conjecture is perfectly supported for up to by numerical optimization when  this inequality is exactly bw inequality when  this inequality leads the sharp bound for the function which is recently derived for the application to universal constraints of relaxation rates in open quantum dynamics\",\"convex splitting is a powerful technique in quantum information theory used in proving the achievability of numerous information processing protocols such as quantum state redistribution and quantum network channel coding in this work we establish a one shot error exponent and a one shot strong converse for convex splitting with trace distance as an error criterion our results show that the derived error exponent strong converse exponent is positive if and only if the rate is in outside the achievable region this leads to new one shot exponent results in various tasks such as communication over quantum wiretap channels secret key distillation one way quantum message compression quantum measurement simulation and quantum channel coding with side information at the transmitter we also establish a near optimal one shot characterization of the sample complexity for convex splitting which yields matched second order asymptotics this then leads to stronger one shot analysis in many quantum information theoretic tasks\",\"in a recent paper hirche and leditzky introduced the notion of bi ppt channels which are quantum channels that stay completely positive under composition with a transposition and such that the same property holds for one of their complementary channels they asked whether there are examples of such channels that are not antidegradable we show that this is not the case since bi ppt channels are always entanglement breaking we also show that degradable quantum channels staying completely positive under composition with a transposition are entanglement breaking\",\"a set of classical or quantum states is equivalent to another one if there exists a pair of classical or quantum channels mapping either set to the other one for dichotomies pairs of states this is closely connected to classical or quantum renyi divergences rd and the data processing inequality if a rd remains unchanged when a channel is applied to the dichotomy then there is a recovery channel mapping the image back to the initial dichotomy here we prove for classical dichotomies that equality of the rds alone is already sufficient for the existence of a channel in any of the two directions and discuss some applications we conjecture that equality of the minimal quantum rds is sufficient in the quantum case and prove it for special cases we also show that neither the petz quantum nor the maximal quantum rds are sufficient as a side result of our techniques we obtain an infinite list of inequalities fulfilled by the classical the petz quantum and the maximal quantum rds these inequalities are not true for the minimal quantum rds\",\"we consider two related tasks a estimating a parameterisation of a given gibbs state and expectation values of lipschitz observables on this state and b learning the expectation values of local observables within a thermal or quantum phase of matter in both cases we wish to minimise the number of samples we use to learn these properties to a given precision for the first task we develop new techniques to learn parameterisations of classes of systems including quantum gibbs states of non commuting hamiltonians with exponential decay of correlations and the approximate markov property we show it is possible to infer the expectation values of all extensive properties of the state from a number of copies that not only scales polylogarithmically with the system size but polynomially in the observables locality an exponential improvement this set of properties includes expected values of quasi local observables and entropies for the second task we develop efficient algorithms for learning observables in a phase of matter of a quantum system by exploiting the locality of the hamiltonian we show that local observables can be learned with probability to precision with using only samples an exponential improvement on the precision over previous bounds our results apply to both families of ground states of hamiltonians displaying local topological quantum order and thermal phases of matter with exponential decay of correlations in addition our sample complexity applies to the worse case setting whereas previous results only applied on average furthermore we develop tools of independent interest such as robust shadow tomography algorithms gibbs approximations to ground states and generalisations of transportation cost inequalities for gibbs states\",\"the quantum relative entropy is known to play a key role in determining the asymptotic convertibility of quantum states in general resource theoretic settings often constituting the unique monotone that is relevant in the asymptotic regime we show that this is no longer the case when one allows stochastic protocols that may only succeed with some probability in which case the quantum relative entropy is insufficient to characterize the rates of asymptotic state transformations and a new entropic quantity based on a regularization of the hilbert projective metric comes into play such a scenario is motivated by a setting where the cost associated with transformations of quantum states typically taken to be the number of copies of a given state is instead identified with the size of the quantum memory needed to realize the protocol our approach allows for constructing transformation protocols that achieve strictly higher rates than those imposed by the relative entropy focusing on the task of resource distillation we give broadly applicable strong converse bounds on the asymptotic rates of probabilistic distillation protocols and show them to be tight in relevant settings such as entanglement distillation with non entangling operations this generalizes and extends previously known limitations that only applied to deterministic protocols our methods are based on recent results for probabilistic one shot transformations as well as a new asymptotic equipartition property for the projective relative entropy\",\"completely positive and trace preserving cpt maps are important for quantum information theory because they describe a broad class of of transformations of quantum states there are also two other related classes of maps the unital completely positive ucp maps and the unital completely positive and trace preserving ucpt maps for these three classes the maps from a finite dimensional hilbert space to another one is a compact convex set and as such it is the convex hull of its extreme points the extreme points of these convex sets are yet not well understood in this article we investigate the preservation of extremality under the tensor product we prove that extremality is preserved for cpt or ucp maps but for ucpt it is not always preserved\",\"we show that a simple telescoping sum trick together with the triangle inequality and a tensorisation property of expected contractive coefficients of random channels allow us to achieve general simultaneous decoupling for multiple users via local actions employing both old dupuis et al commun math phys   and new methods dupuis arxiv we obtain bounds on the expected deviation from ideal decoupling either in the one shot setting in terms of smooth min entropies or the finite block length setting in terms of renyi entropies these bounds are essentially optimal without the need to address the simultaneous smoothing conjecture which remains unresolved this leads to one shot finite block length and asymptotic achievability results for several tasks in quantum shannon theory including local randomness extraction of multiple parties multi party assisted entanglement concentration multi party quantum state merging and quantum coding for the quantum multiple access channel because of the one shot nature of our protocols we obtain achievability results without the need for time sharing which at the same time leads to easy proofs of the asymptotic coding theorems we show that our one shot decoupling bounds furthermore yield achievable rates so far only conjectured for multi user randomness extraction multipartite state merging and quantum multiple access channel communication in compound settings that is for only partially known iid source or channel\",\"we show that the proof of the generalised quantum steins lemma brandao  plenio commun math phys   is not correct due to a gap in the argument leading to lemma iii hence the main achievability result of brandao  plenio is not known to hold this puts into question a number of established results in the literature in particular the reversibility of quantum entanglement brandao  plenio commun math phys   nat phys   and of general quantum resources brandao  gour phys rev lett   under asymptotically resource non generating operations we discuss potential ways to recover variants of the newly unsettled results using other approaches\",\"the asymptotic equipartition property aep in information theory establishes that independent and identically distributed iid states behave in a way that is similar to uniform states in particular with appropriate smoothing for such states both the min and the max relative entropy asymptotically coincide with the relative entropy in this paper we generalize several such equipartition properties to states on general von neumann algebras first we show that the smooth max relative entropy of iid states on a von neumann algebra has an asymptotic rate given by the quantum relative entropy in fact our aep not only applies to states but also to quantum channels with appropriate restrictions in addition going beyond the iid assumption we show that for states that are produced by a sequential process of quantum channels the smooth max relative entropy can be upper bounded by the sum of appropriate channel relative entropies our main technical contributions are to extend to the context of general von neumann algebras a chain rule for quantum channels as well as an additivity result for the channel relative entropy with a replacer channel\",\"integral representations of quantum relative entropy and of the directional second and higher order derivatives of von neumann entropy are established and used to give simple proofs of fundamental known data processing inequalities the holevo bound on the quantity of information transmitted by a quantum communication channel and much more generally the monotonicity of quantum relative entropy under trace preserving positive linear maps complete positivity of the map need not be assumed the latter result was first proved by muller hermes and reeb based on work of beigi for a simple application of such monotonicities we consider any divergence that is non increasing under quantum measurements such as the concavity of von neumann entropy or various known quantum divergences an elegant argument due to hiai ohya and tsukada is used to show that the infimum of such a divergence on pairs of quantum states with prescribed trace distance is the same as the corresponding infimum on pairs of binary classical states applications of the new integral formulae to the general probabilistic model of information theory and a related integral formula for the classical renyi divergence are also discussed\",\"recently measurement based quantum thermal machines draw more attention in the field of quantum thermodynamics however the previous results on quantum otto heat engines were either limited to special unital and non unital channels in the bath stages or a specific driving protocol at the work strokes and assuming the cycle being time reversal symmetric ie or  in this paper we consider a single spin  quantum otto heat engine by first replacing one of the heat baths by an arbitrary unital channel and then we give the exact analytical expression of the characteristic function from which all the cumulants of heat and work emerge we prove that under the effect of monitoring is a necessary condition for positive work either for a symmetric or asymmetric driven otto cycle we trace this back to the negative role of projective measurement we found that considering an arbitrary unital map would enhance the efficiency and the extracted work then we prove the system can never work as a refrigerator this is forbidden by the second law of thermodynamics furthermore going beyond the average we show that the ratio of the fluctuations of work and heat is lower and upper bounded when the system is working as a heat engine however differently from the previous results in the literature we consider and analyze skewness and kurtosis as well we show that in the adiabatic regime the skewness can be arbitrary and that kurtosis can not be below  finally we consider applying a specific unital map that plays the role of a heat bath in a coherently superposed manner and we show the role of the initial coherence of the control qubit on efficiency and the first four cumulants of work in the non adiabatic regime\",\"several central problems in quantum information theory such as measurement compatibility and quantum steering can be rephrased as membership in the minimal matrix convex set corresponding to special polytopes such as the hypercube or its dual in this article we generalize this idea and introduce the notion of polytope compatibility by considering arbitrary polytopes we find that semiclassical magic squares correspond to birkhoff polytope compatibility in general we prove that polytope compatibility is in one to one correspondence with measurement compatibility when the measurements have some elements in common and the post processing of the joint measurement is restricted finally we consider how much tuples operators with appropriate joint numerical range have to be scaled in the worst case in order to become polytope compatible and give both analytical sufficient conditions and numerical ones based on linear programming\",\"gaussian quantum channels are well understood and have many applications eg in quantum information theory and in quantum optics for more general quantum channels one can in general use semiclassical approximations or perturbation theory but it is not easy to judge the accuracy of such methods we study a relatively simple model case where the quantum channel is generated by a lindblad equation where one of the lindblad operators is a multiple of the internal hamiltonian and therefore the channel is not gaussian for this model we can compute the characteristic function of the action of the channel on a gaussian state explicitly and we can as well derive a representation of the propagator in an integral form this allows us to compare the exact results with semiclassical approximations and perturbation theory and evaluate their accuracy we finally apply these results to the study of the evolution of the von neumann entropy of a state\",\"preparing ground states and thermal states is of key importance to simulating quantum systems on a quantum computer despite the hope for practical quantum advantage in quantum simulation popular approaches like variational circuits or adiabatic algorithms appear to face serious difficulties monte carlo style quantum gibbs samplers have emerged as an alternative but prior proposals have been unsatisfactory due to technical obstacles related to energy time uncertainty we introduce simple continuous time quantum gibbs samplers that overcome these obstacles by efficiently simulating nature inspired quantum master equations liouvillians utilizing the operator fourier transform in addition we construct the first provably accurate and efficient algorithm for preparing certain purified gibbs states called thermal field double states in high energy physics of rapidly thermalizing systems this algorithm also benefits from a szegedy type quadratic improvement with respect to the mixing time our algorithms cost has a favorable dependence on temperature accuracy and the mixing time or spectral gap of the relevant liouvillians we contribute to the theory of thermalization by developing a general analytic framework that handles energy uncertainty through non asymptotic secular approximation and approximate detailed balance establishing our approximation guarantees and as a byproduct yielding the first rigorous proof of finite time thermalization for physically derived liouvillians given the success of the classical metropolis algorithm and the ubiquity of thermodynamics we anticipate that quantum gibbs sampling will become an indispensable tool in quantum computing\",\"we prove that the body operator of a fermionic particle state obeys  which complements the bound of yang that  this estimate furthermore resolves a conjecture of carlen lieb reuvers arxiv concerning the entropy of the normalized body operator we also prove that the hilbert schmidt norm of the truncated body operator obeys the inequality \",\"we show that the communication cost of quantum broadcast channel simulation under free entanglement assistance between the sender and the receivers is asymptotically characterized by an efficiently computable single letter formula in terms of the channels multipartite mutual information our core contribution is a new one shot achievability result for multipartite quantum state splitting via multipartite convex splitting as part of this we face a general instance of the quantum joint typicality problem with arbitrarily overlapping marginals the crucial technical ingredient to sidestep this difficulty is a conceptually novel multipartite mean zero decomposition lemma together with employing recently introduced complex interpolation techniques for sandwiched renyi divergences moreover we establish an exponential convergence of the simulation error when the communication costs are within the interior of the capacity region as the costs approach the boundary of the capacity region moderately quickly we show that the error still vanishes asymptotically\",\"active states from which work can be extracted by time dependent perturbations are an important resource for quantum thermodynamics in the absence of heat baths here we characterize this resource establishing a resource theory that captures the operational scenario where an experimenter manipulates a quantum system by means of energy preserving operations and resets to non active states our resource theory comes with

we outline the development of an algorithm for quickly computing the result of a vector that is passed through an equivariant linear layer for each group in question the success of our approach suggests that category theory could be beneficial for other areas of deep learning\",\"the aim of this article is to analyze numerical schemes using two layer neural networks with infinite width for the resolution of the high dimensional poisson neumann partial differential equations pdes with neumann boundary conditions using barrons representation of the solution with a measure of probability the energy is minimized thanks to a gradient curve dynamic on the wasserstein space of parameters defining the neural network inspired by the work from bach and chizat we prove that if the gradient curve converges then the represented function is the solution of the elliptic equation considered numerical experiments are given to show the potential of the method\",\"while hopfield networks are known as paradigmatic models for memory storage and retrieval modern artificial intelligence systems mainly stand on the machine learning paradigm we show that it is possible to formulate a teacher student self supervised learning problem with boltzmann machines in terms of a suitable generalization of the hopfield model with structured patterns where the spin variables are the machine weights and patterns correspond to the training sets examples we analyze the learning performance by studying the phase diagram in terms of the training set size the dataset noise and the inference

the art machine learning libraries eg tensorflow or pytorch physics informed neural networks pinns are an attractive tool for solving partial differential equations based on sparse and noisy data here extend pinns to solve obstacle related pdes which present a great computational challenge because they necessitate numerical methods that can yield an accurate approximation of the solution that lies above a given obstacle the performance of the proposed pinns is demonstrated in multiple scenarios for linear and nonlinear pdes subject to regular and irregular obstacles\",\"viewing transformers as interacting particle systems we describe the geometry of learned representations when the weights are not time dependent we show that particles representing tokens tend to cluster toward particular limiting objects as time tends to infinity cluster locations are determined by the initial tokens confirming context awareness of representations learned by transformers using techniques from dynamical systems and partial differential equations we show that the type of limiting object that emerges depends on the spectrum of the value matrix additionally in the one dimensional case we prove that the self attention matrix converges to a low rank boolean matrix the combination of these results mathematically confirms the empirical observation made by vaswani et al vsp that leaders appear

model such process by an interacting particle system with attractive and repulsive forces and the allen cahn force arising in the modeling of phase transition the dynamics of the system is a reaction diffusion process which can separate particles without blowing up this induces an allen cahn message passing acmp for graph neural networks where the numerical iteration for the particle system solution constitutes the message passing propagation acmp which has a simple implementation with a neural ode solver can propel the network depth up to one hundred of layers with theoretically proven

suzuki  clarified that the learning ability of dnn is superior to the previous theories when the target function is non smooth functions however as far as the author is aware none of the numerous works to date attempted to mathematically investigate what kind of dnn architectures really induce pointwise convergence of gradient descent without any statistical argument and this attempt seems to be closer to the practical dnns in this paper we restrict target functions to non smooth indicator functions and construct a deep neural network inducing pointwise convergence provided by mini batch gradient descent process in relu dnn\",\"we combine concepts from multilevel solvers for partial differential equations pdes with neural network based deep learning and propose a new methodology for the efficient numerical solution of high dimensional parametric pdes an in depth theoretical analysis shows that the proposed architecture is able to approximate multigrid v cycles to arbitrary precision with the number of weights only depending logarithmically on the resolution of the finest mesh as a consequence approximation bounds for the solution of parametric pdes by neural networks that are independent on the stochastic parameter dimension can be derived the performance of the proposed method is illustrated on high dimensional parametric linear elliptic pdes that are common benchmark problems in uncertainty quantification we find substantial improvements over state of the art deep learning based solvers as particularly challenging examples random conductivity with high dimensional non affine gaussian fields in parameter dimensions and a random cookie problem are examined due to the multilevel structure of our method the amount of training samples can be reduced on finer levels hence significantly lowering the generation time for training data and the training time of our method\",\"the learnable linear neural network layers between tensor power spaces of that are equivariant to the orthogonal group  the special orthogonal group  and the symplectic group  were characterised in arxiv we present an algorithm for multiplying a vector by any weight matrix for each of these groups using category theoretic constructions to implement the procedure we achieve a significant reduction in computational cost compared with a naive implementation by making use of kronecker product matrices to perform the multiplication we show that our approach extends to the symmetric group  recovering the algorithm of arxiv in the process\",\"predicting the future development of an anatomical shape from a single baseline observation is a challenging task but it can be essential for clinical decision making research has shown that it should be tackled in curved shape spaces as eg disease related shape changes frequently expose nonlinear characteristics we thus propose a novel prediction method that encodes the whole shape in a riemannian shape space it then learns a simple prediction technique founded on hierarchical statistical modeling of longitudinal training data when applied to predict the future development of the shape of the right hippocampus

activation functions rather than being pointwise rescale feature vectors by a function depending only on their norm we call such networks radial neural networks extending previous work on rotation equivariant networks that considers rescaling activations in less generality we prove universal approximation theorems for radial neural networks including in the more difficult cases of bounded widths and unbounded domains our proof techniques are novel distinct from those in the pointwise case additionally radial neural networks exhibit a rich group of orthogonal change of basis symmetries on the vector space of trainable parameters factoring out these symmetries leads to a practical lossless model compression algorithm optimization of the compressed model by gradient descent is equivalent to projected gradient descent for the full model\",\"parametrizations of data manifolds in shape spaces can be computed using the rich toolbox of riemannian geometry this however often comes with high computational costs which raises the question if one can learn an efficient neural network approximation we show that this is indeed possible for shape spaces with a special product structure namely those smoothly approximable by a direct sum of low dimensional manifolds our proposed architecture leverages this structure by separately learning approximations for the low dimensional factors and a subsequent combination after developing the approach as a general framework we apply it to a shape space of triangular surfaces here typical examples of data manifolds are given through datasets of articulated models and can be factorized for example by a sparse principal geodesic analysis spga we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach with experiments

guarantees on the worst case residual error of a pinn across the spatio temporal domain a measure akin to the tolerance of numerical solvers focusing instead on point wise comparisons between their solution and the ones obtained by a solver on a set of inputs in real world applications one cannot consider tests on a finite set of points to be sufficient grounds for deployment as the performance could be substantially worse on a different set to alleviate this issue we establish tolerance based correctness conditions for pinns over the entire input domain to verify the extent to which they hold we introduce crown a general efficient and scalable post training framework to bound pinn residual errors we demonstrate its effectiveness in obtaining tight certificates by applying it to two classically studied pdes burgers and schrodingers equations  and two more challenging ones with real world applications the allan cahn and diffusion sorption equations\",\"we introduce brain inspired

proportional to the length of each neuron connection we demonstrate that bimt discovers useful modular neural networks for many simple tasks revealing compositional structures in symbolic formulas interpretable decision boundaries and features for classification and mathematical structure in algorithmic datasets the ability to directly see modules with the naked eye can complement current mechanistic interpretability strategies such as probes interventions or staring at all weights\",\"networks have provided extremely successful models of data and complex systems yet as combinatorial objects networks do not have in general intrinsic coordinates and do not typically lie in an ambient space the process of assigning an embedding space to a network has attracted lots of interest in

vibrant research activity on these subjects\",\"this paper presents a mathematical analysis of ode net a continuum model of deep neural networks dnns in recent years machine learning researchers have introduced ideas of replacing the deep structure of dnns with odes as a continuum limit these studies regard the learning of ode net as the minimization of a loss constrained by a parametric ode although the existence of a minimizer for this minimization problem needs to be assumed only a few studies have investigated its existence analytically in detail in the present paper the existence of a minimizer is discussed based on a formulation of ode net as a measure theoretic mean field optimal control problem the existence result is proved when a neural network which describes a vector field of ode net is linear with respect to learnable parameters the proof employs the measure theoretic formulation combined with the direct method of calculus of variations secondly an idealized minimization problem is proposed to remove the above linearity assumption such a problem is inspired by a kinetic regularization associated with the benamou brenier formula and universal approximation theorems for neural networks the proofs of these existence results use variational methods differential equations and mean field optimal control theory they will stand for a new analytic way to investigate the learning process of deep neural networks\",\"universality is a key hypothesis in mechanistic interpretability that different models learn similar features and circuits when trained on similar tasks in this work we study the universality hypothesis by examining how small neural networks learn to implement group composition we present a novel algorithm by which neural networks may implement composition for any finite group via mathematical representation theory we then show that networks consistently learn this algorithm by reverse engineering model logits and weights and confirm our understanding using ablations by studying networks of differing architectures trained on various groups we find mixed evidence for universality using our algorithm we can completely characterize the family of circuits and features that networks learn on this task but for a given network the precise circuits learned as well as the order they develop are arbitrary\",\"in this

of learning models from multiple users each user having their own local data set in a way that is sensitive to data privacy and to communication loss constraints in clustered federated learning one assumes an additional unknown group structure among users and the goal is to train models that are useful for each group rather than simply training a single global model for all users in this paper we propose a novel solution to the problem of clustered federated learning that is inspired by ideas in consensus based optimization cbo our new cbo type method is based on a system of interacting particles that is oblivious to group memberships our model is motivated by rigorous mathematical reasoning including a mean field analysis describing the large number of particles limit of our

consistent signatures for curves subject to a given group of transformations in the plane we compare the proposed schemes to alternative state of the art axiomatic constructions of differential invariants we evaluate our models qualitatively and quantitatively and propose a benchmark dataset to evaluate approximation models of differential invariants of planar curves\",\"group equivariant convolutional neural networks g cnns have been successfully applied in geometric deep learning typically g cnns have the advantage over cnns that they do not waste network capacity on training symmetries that should have been hard coded in the network the recently introduced framework of pde based g cnns pde g cnns generalises g cnns pde g cnns have the core advantages that they simultaneously  reduce network complexity  increase classification performance and  provide geometric interpretability their implementations primarily consist of linear and morphological convolutions with kernels in this paper we show that the previously suggested approximative morphological kernels do not always accurately approximate the exact kernels accurately more specifically depending on the spatial anisotropy of the riemannian metric we argue that one must resort to sub riemannian approximations we solve this problem by providing a new approximative kernel that works regardless of the anisotropy we provide new theorems with better error estimates of the approximative kernels and prove that they all carry the same reflectional symmetries as the exact ones we test the effectiveness of multiple approximative kernels within the pde g cnn framework on two datasets and observe an improvement with the new approximative kernels we report that the pde g cnns again allow for a considerable reduction of network complexity while having comparable or better performance than g cnns and cnns on the two datasets moreover pde g cnns have the advantage of better geometric interpretability over g cnns as the morphological kernels are related to association fields from

impact of uncertain geometry perturbations on the effective mechanical properties of elastic rods to be more precise we consider elastic rods modeled as three dimensional linearly elastic bodies occupying randomly perturbed domains our focus is on a model where the cross section of the rod is shifted along the longitudinal axis with stationary increments to efficiently obtain accurate estimates on the resulting uncertainty of the effective elastic moduli we use a combination of analytical and numerical methods specifically we rigorously derive a one dimensional surrogate model by analyzing the slender rod limit additionally we establish qualitative and quantitative stochastic homogenization results for the one dimensional surrogate model to compare the fluctuations of the surrogate with the original three dimensional model we perform numerical simulations by means of finite element analysis and monte carlo methods\",\"we present a quantitative geometric rigidity estimate in dimensions generalizing the celebrated result by friesecke james and muller to the setting of variable domains loosely speaking we show that for each and for each connected component of a

optimal shape of crystalline materials in the setting of stress driven rearrangement instabilities sdri are extended from two dimensions to any dimensions  the energy is the sum of the elastic and the surface energy contributions which cannot be decoupled and depend on configurational pairs consisting of a set and a function that model the region occupied by the crystal and the bulk displacement field respectively by following the physical literature the driving stress due to the mismatch between the ideal free standing equilibrium lattice of the crystal with respect to adjacent materials is included in the model by considering a discontinuous mismatch strain in the elastic energy since two dimensional methods and the methods used in the previous literature where dirichlet boundary conditions instead of the mismatch strain and only the wetting regime were considered cannot be employed in this setting we proceed differently by including in the analysis the dewetting regime and carefully analyzing the fine properties of energy equibounded sequences this analysis allows to establish both a compactness property in the family of admissible configurations and the lower

such models\",\"we propose a collocation method based on multivariate polynomial splines over triangulation or tetrahedralization for the numerical solution of partial differential equations we start with a detailed explanation of the method for the poisson equation and then extend the study to the second order elliptic pde in non divergence form we shall show that the numerical solution can approximate the exact pde solution very well then we present a large amount of numerical experimental results to demonstrate the performance of the method over the d and d settings in addition we present a comparison with the existing multivariate spline methods in and to show that the new method produces a similar and sometimes more accurate approximation in a more efficient fashion\",\"we derive a dimension reduction limit for a three dimensional rod with material voids by means of convergence hereby we generalize the results of the purely elastic setting  to a framework of free discontinuity problems the effective one dimensional model features a classical elastic bending torsion energy but also accounts for the possibility that the limiting rod can be broken apart into

where each element describes a shape so called shape spaces are of particular interest in shape optimization and its applications theory and algorithms in shape optimization are often based on techniques from differential geometry challenges arise when an application demands a non smooth shape which is commonly encountered as an optimal shape for fluid mechanical problems in order to avoid the restriction to infinitely smooth shapes of a commonly used shape space we construct a space containing shapes in that can be identified with a riemannian product manifold but at the same time admits piecewise smooth curves as elements we combine the new product manifold with an approach for optimizing multiple non intersecting shapes for the newly defined shapes adjustments are made in the known shape optimization definitions and algorithms to ensure their usability in applications numerical results regarding a fluid mechanical problem constrained by the navier stokes equations where

koiters model for a linearly elastic elliptic membrane shell subjected to remaining confined in a prescribed half space first we show that the solution of the obstacle problem under consideration is uniquely determined and satisfies a set of variational inequalities which are governed by a fourth order elliptic operator and which are posed over a non empty closed and convex subset of a suitable space second we show that the solution of the obstacle problem under consideration can be approximated by means of the penalty method third we show that the solution of the corresponding penalised problem is more regular up to the boundary fourth we write down the mixed variational formulation corresponding to the penalised problem under consideration and we show that the solution of the mixed variational formulation is more regular up to the boundary as well in view of this result concerning the augmentation of the regularity of the solution of the mixed penalised problem we are able to

with uniform bending ie constant mean curvature starting from the atomic scale with a discrete distribution of dipoles we obtain the continuum limit of the electrostatic energy the continuum energy depends on the geometric parameters that define the nanostructure such as the pitch and twist of the helical nanotubes and the curvature of the thin film we find that the limiting energy is local in nature this can be rationalized by noticing that the decay of the dipole kernel is sufficiently fast when the lattice sums run over one and two dimensions and is also consistent with prior work on dimension reduction of continuum micromagnetic bodies to the thin film limit however an interesting contrast between the discrete to continuum approach and the continuum dimension reduction approaches is that the limit energy in the latter depends only on the normal component of the dipole field whereas in the discrete to continuum approach both tangential and normal components of the dipole field contribute to the limit energy\",\"we design and analyze an iterative two grid algorithm for the finite element discretizations of strongly nonlinear elliptic boundary value problems in this paper we propose an iterative two grid algorithm in which a nonlinear problem is first solved on the coarse space and then a symmetric positive definite problem is solved on the fine space the innovation of this paper lies in the establishment of a first convergence analysis which requires simultaneous estimation of four interconnected error estimates we also present some numerical experiments to confirm the efficiency of the proposed algorithm\",\"we rigorously derive a strain gradient model of plasticity as a limit of continuum bodies containing finitely many edge dislocations in two dimensions the key difference from previous such derivations is the elemental notion of a dislocation a dislocation is a singularity in the lattice structure which induces a geometric incompatibility in a continuum framework in which we work the lattice structure is represented by a smooth frame field and the presence of a dislocation manifests in a circulation condition on that frame field in previous works dislocations were encoded via a curl condition on strain fields which can be obtained formally by linearizing the geometric incompatibility in our model in a similar sense to the additive decomposition of strain being the linearization of the multiplicative one the multiplicative nature of the geometric incompatibility generates many technical challenges which require a systematic study of the geometry of bodies containing multiple dislocations the definition of new notions of convergence and the derivation of new geometric rigidity estimates pertinent to dislocated bodies our approach places the strain gradient limit in a unified framework with other models of dislocations which cannot be addressed within the admissible strain approach\",\"in this paper we identify a set

application is a mode i delamination problem for which the cohesive law for the interface is formulated starting from the graded damage concept ie by prescribing the shape of damage distribution within the cohesive process zone\",\"in the stationary case atomistic interaction energies can be proved to converge to classical elasticity models in the simultaneous atomistic to continuum and linearization limit  the aim of this note is that of extending the convergence analysis to the dynamic setting moving within the framework of  we prove that solutions of the equation of motion driven by atomistic deformation energies converge to the solutions of the momentum equation for the corresponding continuum energy of linearized elasticity by recasting the evolution problems in their

dislocation lines in dimension  the result presented here shows that the line tension energy of unions of single line defects converge to the energy associated to macroscopic densities of dislocations

the elastic structure is represented by a vector valued phase field variable and a corresponding optimality system consisting of a state equation and a gradient inequality was derived in the present paper we pass to the sharp interface limit in this optimality system by the technique of formally matched asymptotics therefore we derive suitable lagrange multipliers to formulate the gradient inequality as a pointwise equality afterwards we introduce inner and outer expansions relate them by suitable matching conditions and formally pass to the sharp interface limit by comparing the leading order terms in the state equation and in the gradient equality furthermore the relation between these formally derived first order conditions and results of allaire and jouve comput methods

for the system of linear partial differential equations describing the thin infinite elastic rod with material coefficients which periodically highly oscillate along the rod the resolvent asymptotics is derived simultaneously with respect to the thickness of the rod and the period of material oscillations these two parameters are taken to be of the same order the analysis is carried out separately

lorentz invariance violation we find the connection between the most general modified dispersion relation and a pseudo finsler structure and then we calculate the arrival time delay of astroparticles with different modified dispersion relations in the framework of finsler geometry the result suggests that the time delay is irrelevant with the exact form of the modified dispersion relation if the

coordinate systems separable metrics are very important in mathematics and physics the stackel problem is which metrics admit complete separation of variables in the geodesic hamilton jacobi equation this problem was solved for metrics with nonzero diagonal elements in particular for positive definite riemannian metrics long ago however the question is open for indefinite metrics having zeroes on

similar to that of curvature on riemannian manifolds here we continue our studies on the development of the schwarzian derivative on finsler manifolds first we obtain an integrability condition for the mobius equations then we obtain a rigidity result as follows let be a connected complete finsler manifold of positive constant ricci curvature if it admits non trivial mobius mapping then is homeomorphic to the sphere finally we reconfirm thurstons hypothesis for complete finsler manifolds and show that the schwarzian derivative of a projective parameter plays the same role as the ricci

intervals as an application a universal existence and regularity theorem for gradient flow is obtained in the finsler setting secondly we study absolutely continuous curves in wasserstein spaces over finsler manifolds and establish the lisini structure theorem in this setting which characterize the nature of absolutely continuous curves in wasserstein spaces in terms of dynamical transference plans concentrated on absolutely continuous curves in base finsler manifolds besides a close relation between continuity equations and absolutely continuous curves in wasserstein spaces is founded

both distributions are one dimensional and the mixed scalar curvature of a riemannian almost product structure if both distributions together span the tangent bundle we derive euler lagrange equations for the functional formulated in terms of extrinsic geometry of distributions ie their second fundamental forms and integrability tensors we give examples of critical metrics for distributions defined on domains of riemannian submersions twisted products and contact manifolds\",\"we first present the natural definitions of the horizontal differential the divergence as an adjoint operator and a

relate the intrinsic torsion of a foliated aristotelian manifold to its godbillon vey class and interpret it as a measure of the local spin of the spatial leaves in the time direction with this characterisation the godbillon vey class is an obstruction to integrability of the structure defining the aristotelian spacetime we use these notions to formulate a new geometric approach to hydrodynamics of fluid flows by endowing them with aristotelian structures we establish conditions under which the godbillon vey class represents an obstruction to steady flow of the fluid and prove

validate the excellent reachability of the vqs proving the near perfect reachability of the vqs with a depth ansatz for any number of qubits completes an essential step in proving its exponential

systems are inherently susceptible to noises which adversely corrupt the information encoded in quantum systems in this work we introduce an efficient algorithm that can recover information from quantum states under pauli noise the core idea is to learn the necessary information of the unknown pauli channel by post processing the classical shadows of the channel for a local and bounded degree observable only partial knowledge of the channel is required rather than its complete classical description to recover the ideal information resulting in a polynomial time algorithm this contrasts with conventional methods such as probabilistic error cancellation which requires the full information of the channel and exhibits exponential scaling with the number of qubits we also prove that this

semitoric systems by modifying the coupled spin oscillator and the coupled angular momenta and we also classify their singular points additionally we describe the dynamics of these systems through the image of their respective momentum maps\",\"we formulate and study a generalized virial theorem for contact hamiltonian systems such systems describe mechanical systems in the presence of simple dissipative forces such as rayleigh friction or the vertical motion of a particle falling through a fluid quadratic drag under the action of constant gravity we find a generalized virial theorem for contact hamiltonian systems which is distinct from that obtained earlier for the symplectic case the contact generalized virial theorem is shown to reduce to the earlier result on symplectic manifolds

an introduction to this form of integrabilty we will start by introducing the necessary concepts from contact geometry which is the sister geometry of symplectic geometry in the third chapter we discuss the contact hamiltonian vector field which is similar to the standard hamiltonian vector field and the jacobi bracket which has similar dynamical properties as the poisson bracket in the symplectic world after this we are able to introduce contact complete integrability there exist at least two different notions of such integrability in the literature one by khesin  tabachnikov which has a more geometric nature and one by jovanovic  jovanovic we will show that both notions coincide subsequently we will give an overview of the semi local aspects of contact complete integrability namely the behaviour of the dynamics near regular fibres an arnold liouville like theorem by jovanovic and singular fibres a local normal form as described by miranda finally we will introduce contact

holding the symplectic structure of the entire phase space in which the variational principle should be well posed using these embeddings we establish a methodology to set appropriate boundary

representing equilibrium states being restricted to certain submanifolds of this phase space we demonstrate that hamilton jacobi theory consistently describes thermodynamic transformations on the space of externally controllable parameters or equivalently the space of equilibrium states it turns out that in the hamilton jacobi description the choice of the principal function is not unique but the resultant dynamical description for a given transformation remains the same irrespective of this choice some examples involving thermodynamic transformations of the ideal gas are discussed where the characteristic curves on the space of equilibrium states completely describe the dynamics the geometric hamilton jacobi formulation which has emerged recently is also discussed in the context of
