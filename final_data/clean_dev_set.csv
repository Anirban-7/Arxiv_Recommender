0,Inverse Approximation Theory for Nonlinear Recurrent Neural Networks,"We prove an inverse approximation theorem for the approximation of nonlinear
sequence-to-sequence relationships using RNNs. This is a so-called
Bernstein-type result in approximation theory, which deduces properties of a
target function under the assumption that it can be effectively approximated by
a hypothesis space. In particular, we show that nonlinear sequence
relationships, viewed as functional sequences, that can be stably approximated
by RNNs with hardtanh/tanh activations must have an exponential decaying memory
structure -- a notion that can be made precise. This extends the previously
identified curse of memory in linear RNNs into the general nonlinear setting,
and quantifies the essential limitations of the RNN architecture for learning
sequential relationships with long-term memory. Based on the analysis, we
propose a principled reparameterization method to overcome the limitations. Our
theoretical results are confirmed by numerical experiments.","Shida Wang,Zhong Li,Qianxiao Li",['DS'],inverse approximation theory for nonlinear recurrent neural networkswe prove an inverse approximation theorem for the approximation of nonlinear sequence to sequence relationships using rnns this is a so called bernstein type result in approximation theory which deduces properties of a target function under the assumption that it can be effectively approximated by a hypothesis space in particular we show that nonlinear sequence relationships viewed as functional sequences that can be stably approximated by rnns with hardtanhtanh activations must have an exponential decaying memory structure a notion that can be made precise this extends the previously identified curse of memory in linear rnns into the general nonlinear setting and quantifies the essential limitations of the rnn architecture for learning sequential relationships with long term memory based on the analysis we propose a principled reparameterization method to overcome the limitations our theoretical results are confirmed by numerical experiments
1,Sharp Spectral Rates for Koopman Operator Learning,"Non-linear dynamical systems can be handily described by the associated
Koopman operator, whose action evolves every observable of the system forward
in time. Learning the Koopman operator and its spectral decomposition from data
is enabled by a number of algorithms. In this work we present for the first
time non-asymptotic learning bounds for the Koopman eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions. We focus on time-reversal-invariant stochastic dynamical
systems, including the important example of Langevin dynamics. We analyze two
popular estimators: Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) and Reduced Rank
Regression (RRR). Our results critically hinge on novel minimax estimation
bounds for the operator norm error, that may be of independent interest. Our
spectral learning bounds are driven by the simultaneous control of the operator
norm error and a novel metric distortion functional of the estimated
eigenfunctions. The bounds indicates that both EDMD and RRR have similar
variance, but EDMD suffers from a larger bias which might be detrimental to its
learning rate. Our results shed new light on the emergence of spurious
eigenvalues, an issue which is well known empirically. Numerical experiments
illustrate the implications of the bounds in practice.","Vladimir Kostic,Karim Lounici,Pietro Novelli,Massimiliano Pontil",['DS'],sharp spectral rates for koopman operator learningnon linear dynamical systems can be handily described by the associated koopman operator whose action evolves every observable of the system forward in time learning the koopman operator and its spectral decomposition from data is enabled by a number of algorithms in this work we present for the first time non asymptotic learning bounds for the koopman eigenvalues and eigenfunctions we focus on time reversal invariant stochastic dynamical systems including the important example of langevin dynamics we analyze two popular estimators extended dynamic mode decomposition edmd and reduced rank regression rrr our results critically hinge on novel minimax estimation bounds for the operator norm error that may be of independent interest our spectral learning bounds are driven by the simultaneous control of the operator norm error and a novel metric distortion functional of the estimated eigenfunctions the bounds indicates that both edmd and rrr have similar variance but edmd suffers from a larger bias which might be detrimental to its learning rate our results shed new light on the emergence of spurious eigenvalues an issue which is well known empirically numerical experiments illustrate the implications of the bounds in practice
2,Clustering and Arnoux-Rauzy words,"We characterize the clustering of a word under the Burrows-Wheeler transform
in terms of the resolution of a bounded number of bispecial factors belonging
to the language generated by all its powers. We use this criterion to compute,
in every given Arnoux-Rauzy language on three letters, an explicit bound $K$
such that each word of length at least $K$ is not clustering; this bound is
sharp for a set of Arnoux-Rauzy languages including the Tribonacci one. In the
other direction, we characterize all standard Arnoux-Rauzy clustering words,
and all perfectly clustering Arnoux-Rauzy words. We extend some results to
episturmian languages, characterizing those which produce infinitely many
clustering words, and to larger alphabets.","Sébastien Ferenczi,Luca Q.

3,Node Embedding from Neural Hamiltonian Orbits in Graph Neural Networks,"In the graph node embedding problem, embedding spaces can vary significantly
for different data types, leading to the need for different GNN model types. In
this paper, we model the embedding update of a node feature as a Hamiltonian
orbit over time. Since the Hamiltonian orbits generalize the exponential maps,
this approach allows us to learn the underlying manifold of the graph in
training, in contrast to most of the existing literature that assumes a fixed
graph embedding manifold with a closed exponential map solution. Our proposed
node embedding strategy can automatically learn, without extensive tuning, the
underlying geometry of any given graph dataset even if it has diverse
geometries. We test Hamiltonian functions of different forms and verify the
performance of our approach on two graph node embedding downstream tasks: node
classification and link prediction. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our
approach adapts better to different types of graph datasets than popular
state-of-the-art graph node embedding GNNs. The code is available at

4,Equidistribution of iterations of holomorphic correspondences and Hutchinson invariant sets,"In this paper we analyze a certain family of holomorphic correspondences on
$\hat{\mathbb{C}}\times\hat{\mathbb{C}}$ and prove their equidistribution
properties. In particular, for any correspondence in this family we prove that
the naturally associated multivalued map $F$ is such that for any $a\in
\mathbb{C}$, we have that $(F^n)_*(\delta_a)$ converges to a probability
measure $\mu_F$ for which $F_*(\mu_F)=\mu_F d$ where $d$ is the degree of $F$.
This result is used to show that the minimal Hutchinson invariant set,
introduced in [ABS20a], of a large class of operators and for sufficiently
large $n$ exists and is the support of the aforementioned measure. We also
prove that in this situation the minimal Hutchinson-invariant set is a Cantor

5,Belinskaya's theorem is optimal,"Belinskaya's theorem states that given an ergodic measure-preserving
transformation, any other transformation with the same orbits and an
$\mathrm{L}^1$ cocycle must be flip-conjugate to it. Our main result shows that
this theorem is optimal: for all $p<1$ the integrability condition on the
cocycle cannot be relaxed to being in $\mathrm{L}^p$. This also allows us to
answer a question of Kerr and Li: for ergodic measure-preserving

6,Endemic Oscillations for SARS-CoV-2 Omicron -- A SIRS model analysis,"The SIRS model with constant vaccination and immunity waning rates is well
known to show a transition from a disease-free to an endemic equilibrium as the
basic reproduction number $r_0$ is raised above threshold. It is shown that
this model maps to Hethcote's classic endemic model originally published in
1973. In this way one obtains unifying formulas for a whole class of models
showing endemic bifurcation. In particular, if the vaccination rate is smaller
than the recovery rate and $r_- < r_0 < r_+$ for certain upper and lower bounds
$r_\pm$, then trajectories spiral into the endemic equilibrium via damped
infection waves. Latest data of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant suggest that
according to this simplified model continuous vaccination programs will not be
capable to escape the oscillating endemic phase. However, in view of the strong
damping factors predicted by the model, in reality these oscillations will
certainly be overruled by time-dependent contact behaviors.",Florian Nill,['DS'],endemic oscillations for sars cov omicron a sirs model analysisthe sirs model with constant vaccination and immunity waning rates is well known to show a transition from a disease free to an endemic equilibrium as the basic reproduction number is raised above threshold it is shown that this model maps to hethcotes classic endemic model originally published in  in this way one obtains unifying formulas for a whole class of models showing endemic bifurcation in particular if the vaccination rate is smaller than the recovery rate and for certain upper and lower bounds  then trajectories spiral into the endemic equilibrium via damped infection waves latest data of the sars cov omicron variant suggest that according to this simplified model continuous vaccination programs will not be capable to escape the oscillating endemic phase however in view of the strong damping factors predicted by the model in reality these oscillations will certainly be overruled by time dependent contact behaviors
7,Centralizer of fixed point free separating flows,"In this paper, we study the centralizer of a separating continuous flow
without fixed points. We show that if $M$ is a compact metric space and
$\phi_t:M\to M$ is a separating flow without fixed points, then $\phi_t$ has a
quasi-trivial centralizer, that is, if a continuous flow $\psi_t$ commutes with
$\phi_t$, then there exists a continuous function $A: M\to\mathbb{R}$ which is
invariant along the orbit of $\phi_t$ such that $\psi_t(x)=\phi_{A(x)t}(x)$
holds for all $x\in M$. We also show that if $M$ is a compact Riemannian
manifold without boundary and $\Phi_u$ is a separating $C^1$
$\mathbb{R}^d$-action on $M$, then $\Phi_u$ has a quasi-trivial centralizer,
that is, if $\Psi_u$ is a $\mathbb{R}^d$-action on $M$ commuting with $\Phi_u$,

which is invariant along orbit of $\Phi_u$ such that
$\Psi_{u}(x)=\Phi_{A(x)u}(x)$ for all $x\in M$. These improve Theorem 1 of

systems with free boundaries associated with a minimization problem. The
variational structure of Hessian-dependent functional plays a fundamental role
in proving the existence of the minimizers and then the existence of the

9,Asymptotic stability of the fourth order $φ^4$ kink for general perturbations in the energy space,"The Fourth order $\phi^4$ model generalizes the classical $\phi^4$ model of
quantum field theory, sharing the same kink solution. It is also the dispersive
counterpart of the well-known parabolic Cahn-Hilliard equation. Mathematically
speaking, the kink is characterized by a fourth-order nonnegative linear
operator with a simple kernel at the origin but no spectral gap. In this paper,
we consider the kink of this theory, and prove orbital and asymptotic stability
for any perturbation in the energy space.","Christopher Maulén,Claudio Muñoz",['AP'],asymptotic stability of the fourth order kink for general perturbations in the energy spacethe fourth order model generalizes the classical model of quantum field theory sharing the same kink solution it is also the dispersive counterpart of the well known parabolic cahn hilliard equation mathematically speaking the kink is characterized by a fourth order nonnegative linear operator with a simple kernel at the origin but no spectral gap in this paper we consider the kink of this theory and prove orbital and asymptotic stability for any perturbation in the energy space
10,Nonlinear regularization estimates and global well-posedness for the Landau-Coulomb equation near equilibrium,"We consider the Landau equation with Coulomb potential in the spatially
homogeneous case. We show short time propagation of smallness in $L^p$ norms
for $p>3/2$ and instantaneous regularization in Sobolev spaces. This yields new
short time quantitative a priori estimates that are unconditional near
equilibrium. We combine these estimates with existing literature on global
well-posedness for regular data to extend the well-posedness theory to small
$L^p$ data with $p$ arbitrarily close to $3/2$. The threshold $p = 3/2$ agrees
with previous work on conditional regularity for the Landau equation in the far
from equilibrium regime.","William Golding,Maria Gualdani,Amélie Loher",['AP'],nonlinear regularization estimates and global well posedness for the landau coulomb equation near equilibriumwe consider the landau equation with coulomb potential in the spatially homogeneous case we show short time propagation of smallness in norms for and instantaneous regularization in sobolev spaces this yields new short time quantitative a priori estimates that are unconditional near equilibrium we combine these estimates with existing literature on global well posedness for regular data to extend the well posedness theory to small data with arbitrarily close to  the threshold agrees with previous work on conditional regularity for the landau equation in the far from equilibrium regime

weak solutions and of a finite stopping time for a large class of generalized
Newtonian fluids shear-thinning flows. The existence of dissipative solutions
for such flows is known since \cite{abbatiello-feireisl-20}. We submit here an
alternative approach using variational inequality solutions as presented in
\cite{duvaut-lions} in the two-dimensional Bingham flow. In order to prove the
existence of such solutions we regularize the non-linear term and then we apply
a Galerkin method for finally passing to the limit with respect to both
regularization and Galerkin discretization parameters. In a second time, we
prove the existence of a finite stopping time for Ostwald-De Waele and Bingham
flows in dimension \(N \in \{2, 3\}\).","Laurent Chupin,Nicolae Cîndea,Geoffrey Lacour",['AP'],variational inequality solutions and finite stopping time for a class of shear thinning flowsthe aim of this paper is to study the existence of variational inequality weak solutions and of a finite stopping time for a large class of generalized newtonian fluids shear thinning flows the existence of dissipative solutions for such flows is known since  we submit here an alternative approach using variational inequality solutions as presented in in the two dimensional bingham flow in order to prove the existence of such solutions we regularize the non linear term and then we apply a galerkin method for finally passing to the limit with respect to both regularization and galerkin discretization parameters in a second time we prove the existence of a finite stopping time for ostwald de waele and bingham flows in dimension n in

13,Enhanced profile estimates for ovals and translators,"We consider the profile function of ancient ovals and of noncollapsed
translators. Recall that pioneering work of Angenent-Daskalopoulos-Sesum (JDG
'19, Annals '20) gives a sharp $C^0$-estimate and a quadratic concavity
estimate for the profile function of two-convex ancient ovals, which are
crucial in their papers as well as a slew of subsequent papers on ancient
solutions of mean curvature flow and Ricci flow. In this paper, we derive a
sharp gradient estimate, which enhances their $C^0$-estimate, and a sharp
Hessian estimate, which can be viewed as converse of their quadratic concavity
estimate. Motivated by our forthcoming work on ancient noncollapsed flows in
$\mathbb{R}^4$, we derive these estimates in the context of ancient ovals in
$\mathbb{R}^3$ and noncollapsed translators in $\mathbb{R}^4$, though our
methods seem to apply in other settings as well.","Kyeongsu Choi,Robert Haslhofer,Or Hershkovits","['AP', 'DG']",enhanced profile estimates for ovals and translatorswe consider the profile function of ancient ovals and of noncollapsed translators recall that pioneering work of angenent daskalopoulos sesum jdg  annals  gives a sharp estimate and a quadratic concavity estimate for the profile function of two convex ancient ovals which are crucial in their papers as well as a slew of subsequent papers on ancient solutions of mean curvature flow and ricci flow in this paper we derive a sharp gradient estimate which enhances their estimate and a sharp hessian estimate which can be viewed as converse of their quadratic concavity estimate motivated by our forthcoming work on ancient noncollapsed flows in  we derive these estimates in the context of ancient ovals in and noncollapsed translators in  though our methods seem to apply in other settings as well
14,Bohnenblust--Hille inequality for cyclic groups,"For any $N>2$ and the multiplicative cyclic group $\Omega_N$ of order $N$,
consider any function $f:\Omega_N^n\to\C$ and its Fourier expansion
$f(z)=\sum_{\alpha\in\{0,1,\ldots,N-1\}^n}a_\alpha z^\alpha$ with $d=\deg(f)$
denoting the degree $\deg(f)$ as a multivariate polynomial.
  We prove a Bohnenblust--Hille (BH) inequality, which states that for any
$d\ge 1$, the $\ell_{2d/(d+1)}$ norm of the Fourier coefficients of degree-$d$
polynomial $f:\Omega_N^n\to\C$ is bounded by $C(d,N)\|f\|_\infty$ for $C(d,N)$
independent of $n$.
  This is the interpolating case between the now well-understood BH
inequalities for functions on the poly-torus ($N =\infty$) and the hypercube
($N=2$), but, as we explain, those extreme cases of $N$ have special properties
whose absence for intermediate $N$ prevent a proof by the standard BH framework
heretofore employed.
  New techniques are developed exploiting the group structure of $\Omega_N^n$.
  By known reductions (\cite{SVZ}), the cyclic group BH inequality also entails
a noncommutative BH inequality for tensor products of the $N \times N$ complex
matrix algebras (or in the language of quantum mechanics, systems of $N$-level

15,A boundary integral equation method for the complete electrode model in electrical impedance tomography with tests on real-world data,"We develop a boundary integral equation-based numerical method to solve for
the electrostatic potential in two dimensions, inside a medium with piecewise
constant conductivity, where the boundary condition is given by the complete
electrode model (CEM). The CEM is seen as the most accurate model of the
physical setting where electrodes are placed on the surface of an electrically
conductive body, and currents are injected through the electrodes and the
resulting voltages are measured again on these same electrodes. The integral
equation formulation is based on expressing the electrostatic potential as the
solution to a finite number of Laplace equations which are coupled through
boundary matching conditions. This allows us to re-express the solution in
terms of single layer potentials; the problem is thus re-cast as a system of
integral equations on a finite number of smooth curves. We discuss an adaptive
method for the solution of the resulting system of mildly singular integral
equations. This solver is both fast and accurate. We then present a numerical
inverse solver for electrical impedance tomography (EIT) which uses our forward

16,Higher-dimensional routes to the Standard Model bosons,"In the old spirit of Kaluza-Klein, we consider a spacetime of the form $P =
M_4 \times K$, where $K$ is the Lie group $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ equipped with a
left-invariant metric that is not fully right-invariant. This metric has a
${\rm U}(1) \times \mathrm{SU}(3)$ isometry group, corresponding to the
massless gauge bosons, and depends on a parameter $\phi$ with values in a
subspace of $\mathfrak{su}(3)$ isomorphic to $\mathbb{C}^2$. It is shown that
the classical Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian density $R_P - 2 \Lambda$ on the
higher-dimensional manifold $P$, after integration over $K$, encodes not only
the Yang-Mills terms of the Standard Model over $M_4$, as in the usual
Kaluza-Klein calculation, but also a kinetic term $|{\mathrm d}^A \phi|^2$
identical to the covariant derivative of the Higgs field. For $\Lambda$ in an
appropriate range, it also encodes a potential $V(| \phi|^2)$ having absolute
minima with $|\phi_0|^2 \neq 0$, thereby inducing mass terms for the remaining
gauge bosons. The classical masses of the resulting Higgs-like and gauge bosons
are explicitly calculated as functions of the vacuum value $|\phi_0|^2$ in the
simplest version of the model. In more general versions, the classical values
of the strong and electroweak gauge coupling constants are given as functions

18,Double scaling limits of Dirac ensembles and Liouville quantum gravity,"In this paper we study ensembles of finite real spectral triples equipped
with a path integral over the space of possible Dirac operators. In the
noncommutative geometric setting of spectral triples, Dirac operators take the
center stage as a replacement for a metric on a manifold. Thus, this path
integral serves as a noncommutative analogue of integration over metrics, a key
feature of a theory of quantum gravity. From these integrals in the so-called
double scaling limit we derive critical exponents of minimal models from
Liouville conformal field theory coupled with gravity. Additionally, the
asymptotics of the partition function of these models satisfy differential
equations such as Painlev\'e I, as a reduction of the KDV hierarchy, which is

20,Temporal to Spatial Instability in a Flow System: A Comparison,"The definitions of temporal instability and of spatial instability in a flow
system are comparatively surveyed. The simple model of one-dimensional Burgers'
flow is taken as the scenario where such different conceptions of instability
are described. The temporal analysis of instability stems from Lyapunov's
theory, while the spatial analysis of instability interchanges time and space
in defining the evolution variable. Thus, the growth rate parameter for
temporally unstable perturbations of a basic flow state is to be replaced by a
spatial growth rate when a coordinate assumes the role of evolution variable.
Finally, the idea of spatial instability is applied to a Rayleigh-B\'enard
system given by a fluid-saturated horizontal porous layer with an anisotropic
permeability and impermeable boundaries kept at different uniform temperatures.",Antonio Barletta,['MP'],temporal to spatial instability in a flow system a comparisonthe definitions of temporal instability and of spatial instability in a flow system are comparatively surveyed the simple model of one dimensional burgers flow is taken as the scenario where such different conceptions of instability are described the temporal analysis of instability stems from lyapunovs theory while the spatial analysis of instability interchanges time and space in defining the evolution variable thus the growth rate parameter for temporally unstable perturbations of a basic flow state is to be replaced by a spatial growth rate when a coordinate assumes the role of evolution variable finally the idea of spatial instability is applied to a rayleigh benard system given by a fluid saturated horizontal porous layer with an anisotropic permeability and impermeable boundaries kept at different uniform temperatures

minimizers of functionals $\Phi(u)=\int_a^b f(x,u(x),u'(x))\,dx$, where $u\in

23,Size-biased diffusion limits and the inclusion process,"We consider the inclusion process on the complete graph with vanishing
diffusivity, which leads to condensation of particles in the thermodynamic
limit. Describing particle configurations in terms of size-biased and
appropriately scaled empirical measures of mass distribution, we establish
convergence in law of the inclusion process to a measure-valued Markov process
on the space of probability measures. In the case where the diffusivity
vanishes like the inverse of the system size, the derived scaling limit is
equivalent to the well known Poisson-Dirichlet diffusion, offering an
alternative viewpoint on these well-established dynamics. Moreover, our
approach covers all scaling regimes of the system parameters and yields a
natural extension of the Poisson-Dirichlet diffusion to infinite mutation rate.

structures associated to torsion-free affine connections on connected analytic
manifolds with boundary. We show that these structures are generically boundary
rigid, meaning that any automorphism of a generic projective structure that
restricts to the identity on the boundary must itself be the identity. However,

that there exist projective structures which are not boundary rigid. We
characterise these non-rigid structures by the vanishing of a certain local
projective invariant of the boundary.","Jack Borthwick,Niky Kamran",['DG'],boundary rigidity and non rigidity of projective structureswe investigate the property of boundary rigidity for the projective structures associated to torsion free affine connections on connected analytic manifolds with boundary we show that these structures are generically boundary rigid meaning that any automorphism of a generic projective structure that restricts to the identity on the boundary must itself be the identity however and in contrast with what happens for example for conformal structures we show that there exist projective structures which are not boundary rigid we characterise these non rigid structures by the vanishing of a certain local projective invariant of the boundary
25,Higher-dimensional routes to the Standard Model bosons,"In the old spirit of Kaluza-Klein, we consider a spacetime of the form $P =
M_4 \times K$, where $K$ is the Lie group $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ equipped with a
left-invariant metric that is not fully right-invariant. This metric has a
${\rm U}(1) \times \mathrm{SU}(3)$ isometry group, corresponding to the
massless gauge bosons, and depends on a parameter $\phi$ with values in a
subspace of $\mathfrak{su}(3)$ isomorphic to $\mathbb{C}^2$. It is shown that
the classical Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian density $R_P - 2 \Lambda$ on the
higher-dimensional manifold $P$, after integration over $K$, encodes not only
the Yang-Mills terms of the Standard Model over $M_4$, as in the usual
Kaluza-Klein calculation, but also a kinetic term $|{\mathrm d}^A \phi|^2$
identical to the covariant derivative of the Higgs field. For $\Lambda$ in an
appropriate range, it also encodes a potential $V(| \phi|^2)$ having absolute
minima with $|\phi_0|^2 \neq 0$, thereby inducing mass terms for the remaining
gauge bosons. The classical masses of the resulting Higgs-like and gauge bosons
are explicitly calculated as functions of the vacuum value $|\phi_0|^2$ in the
simplest version of the model. In more general versions, the classical values

29,Intrinsic shape analysis in archaeology: A case study on ancient sundials,"This paper explores a novel mathematical approach to extract archaeological
insights from ensembles of similar artifact shapes. We show that by considering
all the shape information in a find collection, it is possible to identify
shape patterns that would be difficult to discern by considering the artifacts
individually or by classifying shapes into predefined archaeological types and
analyzing the associated distinguishing characteristics. Recently, series of
high-resolution digital representations of artifacts have become available, and
we explore their potential on a set of 3D models of ancient Greek and Roman
sundials, with the aim of providing alternatives to the traditional
archaeological method of ``trend extraction by ordination'' (typology). In the
proposed approach, each 3D shape is represented as a point in a shape space --
a high-dimensional, curved, non-Euclidean space. By performing regression in
shape space, we find that for Roman sundials, the bend of the sundials'
shadow-receiving surface changes with the location's latitude. This suggests
that, apart from the inscribed hour lines, also a sundial's shape was adjusted
to the place of installation. As an example of more advanced inference, we use
the identified trend to infer the latitude at which a sundial, whose
installation location is unknown, was placed. We also derive a novel method for
differentiated morphological trend assertion, building upon and extending the
theory of geometric statistics and shape analysis. Specifically, we present a
regression-based method for statistical normalization of shapes that serves as
a means of disentangling parameter-dependent effects (trends) and unexplained
variability.","Martin Hanik,Benjamin Ducke,Hans-Christian Hege,Friederike Fless,Christoph von Tycowicz",['DG'],intrinsic shape analysis in archaeology a case study on ancient sundialsthis paper explores a novel mathematical approach to extract archaeological insights from ensembles of similar artifact shapes we show that by considering all the shape information in a find collection it is possible to identify shape patterns that would be difficult to discern by considering the artifacts individually or by classifying shapes into predefined archaeological types and analyzing the associated distinguishing characteristics recently series of high resolution digital representations of artifacts have become available and we explore their potential on a set of d models of ancient greek and roman sundials with the aim of providing alternatives to the traditional archaeological method of trend extraction by ordination typology in the proposed approach each d shape is represented as a point in a shape space a high dimensional curved non euclidean space by performing regression in shape space we find that for roman sundials the bend of the sundials shadow receiving surface changes with the locations latitude this suggests that apart from the inscribed hour lines also a sundials shape was adjusted to the place of installation as an example of more advanced inference we use the identified trend to infer the latitude at which a sundial whose installation location is unknown was placed we also derive a novel method for differentiated morphological trend assertion building upon and extending the theory of geometric statistics and shape analysis specifically we present a regression based method for statistical normalization of shapes that serves as a means of disentangling parameter dependent effects trends and unexplained variability

hypersurface data and, in particular, via the notion of double null data.
However, this definition was given in a partially gauge-fixed form. In this
paper we generalize the notion of double null data in a fully diffeomorphism
and gauge covariant way, and show that the definition is complete by proving
that no extra conditions are needed to embed the double null data in some

Cauchy problem satisfies a geometric uniqueness property. Specifically, we

conjectural ""gap hypothesis"" for the degree). Translated into toric Kahler
geometry this result yields a sharp lower bound on a toric invariant introduced
by Donaldson, defined as the minimum of the toric Mabuchi functional. We
furthermore reformulate our conjecture as an optimal lower bound on Odaka's
modular height. Along the way we show how to control the height of the
canonical toric model X, with respect to the Kahler-Einstein metric, by the

We show that the log-signature is polynomial if and only if the path is a

43,Family Floer SYZ conjecture for $A_n$ singularity,"We resolve a mathematically precise SYZ conjecture for $A_n$ singularity by
building a quantum-corrected T-duality between two singular torus fibrations
related to the Kahler geometry of the $A_n$-smoothing and the Berkovich
geometry of the $A_n$-resolution, respectively. Our approach involves heavy
computations that embody a non-archimedean version of the partition of unity,
and it confirms the strategy that patching verified local singularity models
brings global SYZ conjecture solutions (like K3 surfaces) within reach. There
is also remarkably explicit extra evidence concerning the collision of singular
fibers and braid group actions. On one hand, we address the central challenge
of matching SYZ singular loci identified by Joyce. In reality, we construct not
merely an isolated SYZ mirror fibration partner, but a parameter-dependent one
that always keeps the matching singular loci plus integral affine structure,

44,Enumerative geometry via the moduli space of super Riemann surfaces,"In this paper we relate volumes of moduli spaces of super Riemann surfaces to
integrals over the moduli space of stable Riemann surfaces $\overline{\cal
M}_{g,n}$. This allows us to prove via algebraic geometry a recursion between
the volumes of moduli spaces of super hyperbolic surfaces previously proven via
super geometry techniques by Stanford and Witten. The recursion between the
volumes of moduli spaces of super hyperbolic surfaces is proven to be
equivalent to the fact that a generating function for the intersection numbers
of a natural collection of cohomology classes $\Theta_{g,n}$ with tautological
classes on $\overline{\cal M}_{g,n}$ is a KdV tau function. This is analogous
to Mirzakhani's proof of the Kontsevich-Witten theorem regarding a generating
function for the intersection numbers of tautological classes on
$\overline{\cal M}_{g,n}$ using volumes of moduli spaces of hyperbolic
surfaces.",Paul Norbury,"['AG', 'GT', 'MP']",enumerative geometry via the moduli space of super riemann surfacesin this paper we relate volumes of moduli spaces of super riemann surfaces to integrals over the moduli space of stable riemann surfaces  this allows us to prove via algebraic geometry a recursion between the volumes of moduli spaces of super hyperbolic surfaces previously proven via super geometry techniques by stanford and witten the recursion between the volumes of moduli spaces of super hyperbolic surfaces is proven to be equivalent to the fact that a generating function for the intersection numbers of a natural collection of cohomology classes with tautological classes on is a kdv tau function this is analogous to mirzakhanis proof of the kontsevich witten theorem regarding a generating function for the intersection numbers of tautological classes on using volumes of moduli spaces of hyperbolic surfaces

$-h^2\Delta + V - E$ in dimension two and higher. The potential $V$, and its
radial derivative $\dell_{r}V$ are bounded away from the origin, have
long-range decay and $V$ is bounded by $r^{-\delta}$ near the origin while
$\dell_{r}V$ is bounded by $r^{-1-\delta}$, where $0\leq\delta\leq
4(\sqrt{2}-1)$. In this setting, we show that the resolvent bound is

46,The Zero Viscosity Limit of Stochastic Navier-Stokes Flows,"We introduce an analogue to Kato's Criterion regarding the inviscid
convergence of stochastic Navier-Stokes flows to the strong solution of the
deterministic Euler equation. Our assumptions cover additive, multiplicative
and transport type noise models. This is achieved firstly for the typical noise
scaling of $\nu^\frac{1}{2}$, before considering a new parameter which
approaches zero with viscosity but at a potentially different rate. We
determine the implications of this for our criterion and clarify a sense in
which the scaling by $\nu^\frac{1}{2}$ is optimal. To enable the analysis we
prove the existence of probabilistically weak, analytically weak solutions to a
general stochastic Navier-Stokes Equation on a bounded domain with no-slip
boundary condition in three spatial dimensions, as well as the existence and
uniqueness of probabilistically strong, analytically weak solutions in two
dimensions. The criterion applies for these solutions in both two and three
dimensions, with some technical simplifications in the 2D case.","Daniel Goodair,Dan Crisan","['AP,MP']",the zero viscosity limit of stochastic navier stokes flowswe introduce an analogue to katos criterion regarding the inviscid convergence of stochastic navier stokes flows to the strong solution of the deterministic euler equation our assumptions cover additive multiplicative and transport type noise models this is achieved firstly for the typical noise scaling of  before considering a new parameter which approaches zero with viscosity but at a potentially different rate we determine the implications of this for our criterion and clarify a sense in which the scaling by is optimal to enable the analysis we prove the existence of probabilistically weak analytically weak solutions to a general stochastic navier stokes equation on a bounded domain with no slip boundary condition in three spatial dimensions as well as the existence and uniqueness of probabilistically strong analytically weak solutions in two dimensions the criterion applies for these solutions in both two and three dimensions with some technical simplifications in the d case
47,It begins with a boundary: A geometric view on probabilistically robust learning,"Although deep neural networks have achieved super-human performance on many
classification tasks, they often exhibit a worrying lack of robustness towards
adversarially generated examples. Thus, considerable effort has been invested
into reformulating Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) into an adversarially
robust framework. Recently, attention has shifted towards approaches which
interpolate between the robustness offered by adversarial training and the
higher clean accuracy and faster training times of ERM. In this paper, we take
a fresh and geometric view on one such method -- Probabilistically Robust
Learning (PRL) (Robey et al., ICML, 2022). We propose a geometric framework for
understanding PRL, which allows us to identify a subtle flaw in its original
formulation and to introduce a family of probabilistic nonlocal perimeter
functionals to address this. We prove existence of solutions using novel
relaxation methods and study properties as well as local limits of the
introduced perimeters.","Leon Bungert,Nicolás García Trillos,Matt Jacobs,Daniel McKenzie,Đorđe Nikolić,Qingsong Wang","['AP', 'OC', 'ST']",it begins with a boundary a geometric view on probabilistically robust learningalthough deep neural networks have achieved super human performance on many classification tasks they often exhibit a worrying lack of robustness towards adversarially generated examples thus considerable effort has been invested into reformulating empirical risk minimization erm into an adversarially robust framework recently attention has shifted towards approaches which interpolate between the robustness offered by adversarial training and the higher clean accuracy and faster training times of erm in this paper we take a fresh and geometric view on one such method probabilistically robust learning prl robey et al icml  we propose a geometric framework for understanding prl which allows us to identify a subtle flaw in its original formulation and to introduce a family of probabilistic nonlocal perimeter functionals to address this we prove existence of solutions using novel relaxation methods and study properties as well as local limits of the introduced perimeters
48,Hamilton-Jacobi scaling limits of Pareto peeling in 2D,"Pareto hull peeling is a discrete algorithm, generalizing convex hull
peeling, for sorting points in Euclidean space. We prove that Pareto peeling of
a random point set in two dimensions has a scaling limit described by a
first-order Hamilton-Jacobi equation and give an explicit formula for the
limiting Hamiltonian, which is both non-coercive and non-convex. This contrasts
with convex peeling, which converges to curvature flow. The proof involves
direct geometric manipulations in the same spirit as Calder (2016).","Ahmed Bou-Rabee,Peter S.

49,Local well-posedness of the higher order nonlinear Schrödinger equation on the half-line: single boundary condition case,"We establish local well-posedness for the higher-order nonlinear
Schr\""odinger equation, formulated on the half-line. We consider the scenario
of associated coefficients such that only one boundary condition is required,
which is assumed to be Dirichlet type. Our functional framework centers around
fractional Sobolev spaces. We treat both high regularity and low regularity
solutions: in the former setting, the relevant nonlinearity can be handled via
the Banach algebra property; in the latter setting, however, delicate
Strichartz estimates must be established. This task is especially challenging
in the framework of nonhomogeneous initial-boundary value problems, as it
involves proving boundary-type Strichartz estimates that are not common in the
study of initial value problems.
  The linear analysis, which is the core of this work, crucially relies on a
weak solution formulation defined through the novel solution formulae obtained
via the Fokas method. In this connection, we note that the higher-order
Schr\""odinger equation comes with an increased level of difficulty due to the
presence of more than one spatial derivative. This feature manifests itself via
several complications throughout the analysis, including (i) analyticity issues
related to complex square roots, which require careful treatment of branch cuts
and deformations of integration contours; (ii) singularities that emerge upon
changes of variables in the Fourier analysis arguments; (iii) complicated
oscillatory kernels in the weak solution formula for the linear
initial-boundary value problem, which require a subtle analysis of the
dispersion in terms of the regularity of the boundary data. The present work
provides a first, complete treatment via the Fokas method of a nonhomogeneous
initial-boundary value problem for a partial differential equation associated
with a multi-term linear differential operator.","Aykut Alkın,Dionyssios Mantzavinos,Türker Özsarı",['AP'],local well posedness of the higher order nonlinear schroedinger equation on the half line single boundary condition casewe establish local well posedness for the higher order nonlinear schrodinger equation formulated on the half line we consider the scenario of associated coefficients such that only one boundary condition is required which is assumed to be dirichlet type our functional framework centers around fractional sobolev spaces we treat both high regularity and low regularity solutions in the former setting the relevant nonlinearity can be handled via the banach algebra property in the latter setting however delicate strichartz estimates must be established this task is especially challenging in the framework of nonhomogeneous initial boundary value problems as it involves proving boundary type strichartz estimates that are not common in the study of initial value problems the linear analysis which is the core of this work crucially relies on a weak solution formulation defined through the novel solution formulae obtained via the fokas method in this connection we note that the higher order schrodinger equation comes with an increased level of difficulty due to the presence of more than one spatial derivative this feature manifests itself via several complications throughout the analysis including i analyticity issues related to complex square roots which require careful treatment of branch cuts and deformations of integration contours ii singularities that emerge upon changes of variables in the fourier analysis arguments iii complicated oscillatory kernels in the weak solution formula for the linear initial boundary value problem which require a subtle analysis of the dispersion in terms of the regularity of the boundary data the present work provides a first complete treatment via the fokas method of a nonhomogeneous initial boundary value problem for a partial differential equation associated with a multi term linear differential operator
