sequence-to-sequence relationships using RNNs. This is a so-called
Bernstein-type result in approximation theory, which deduces properties of a
target function under the assumption that it can be effectively approximated by
a hypothesis space. In particular, we show that nonlinear sequence
relationships, viewed as functional sequences, that can be stably approximated
by RNNs with hardtanh/tanh activations must have an exponential decaying memory
structure -- a notion that can be made precise. This extends the previously
identified curse of memory in linear RNNs into the general nonlinear setting,
and quantifies the essential limitations of the RNN architecture for learning
sequential relationships with long-term memory. Based on the analysis, we
propose a principled reparameterization method to overcome the limitations. Our
theoretical results are confirmed by numerical experiments.",,,,cs.LG,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'math.DS']",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.19190v1,"Shida Wang,Zhong Li,Qianxiao Li",inverse approximation theory for nonlinear recurrent neural networkswe prove an inverse approximation theorem for the approximation of nonlinear sequence to sequence relationships using rnns this is a so called bernstein type result in approximation theory which deduces properties of a target function under the assumption that it can be effectively approximated by a hypothesis space in particular we show that nonlinear sequence relationships viewed as functional sequences that can be stably approximated by rnns with hardtanhtanh activations must have an exponential decaying memory structure a notion that can be made precise this extends the previously identified curse of memory in linear rnns into the general nonlinear setting and quantifies the essential limitations of the rnn architecture for learning sequential relationships with long term memory based on the analysis we propose a principled reparameterization method to overcome the limitations our theoretical results are confirmed by numerical experiments

Koopman operator, whose action evolves every observable of the system forward
in time. Learning the Koopman operator and its spectral decomposition from data
is enabled by a number of algorithms. In this work we present for the first
time non-asymptotic learning bounds for the Koopman eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions. We focus on time-reversal-invariant stochastic dynamical
systems, including the important example of Langevin dynamics. We analyze two
popular estimators: Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) and Reduced Rank
Regression (RRR). Our results critically hinge on novel minimax estimation
bounds for the operator norm error, that may be of independent interest. Our
spectral learning bounds are driven by the simultaneous control of the operator
norm error and a novel metric distortion functional of the estimated
eigenfunctions. The bounds indicates that both EDMD and RRR have similar
variance, but EDMD suffers from a larger bias which might be detrimental to its
learning rate. Our results shed new light on the emergence of spurious
eigenvalues, an issue which is well known empirically. Numerical experiments
illustrate the implications of the bounds in practice.","10 pages, 3 figures, 6 appendices",,,cs.LG,"['cs.LG', 'math.DS']",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.02004v3,"Vladimir Kostic,Karim Lounici,Pietro Novelli,Massimiliano Pontil",sharp spectral rates for koopman operator learningnon linear dynamical systems can be handily described by the associated koopman operator whose action evolves every observable of the system forward in time learning the koopman operator and its spectral decomposition from data is enabled by a number of algorithms in this work we present for the first time non asymptotic learning bounds for the koopman eigenvalues and eigenfunctions we focus on time reversal invariant stochastic dynamical systems including the important example of langevin dynamics we analyze two popular estimators extended dynamic mode decomposition edmd and reduced rank regression rrr our results critically hinge on novel minimax estimation bounds for the operator norm error that may be of independent interest our spectral learning bounds are driven by the simultaneous control of the operator norm error and a novel metric distortion functional of the estimated eigenfunctions the bounds indicates that both edmd and rrr have similar variance but edmd suffers from a larger bias which might be detrimental to its learning rate our results shed new light on the emergence of spurious eigenvalues an issue which is well known empirically numerical experiments illustrate the implications of the bounds in practice

for different data types, leading to the need for different GNN model types. In
this paper, we model the embedding update of a node feature as a Hamiltonian
orbit over time. Since the Hamiltonian orbits generalize the exponential maps,
this approach allows us to learn the underlying manifold of the graph in
training, in contrast to most of the existing literature that assumes a fixed
graph embedding manifold with a closed exponential map solution. Our proposed
node embedding strategy can automatically learn, without extensive tuning, the
underlying geometry of any given graph dataset even if it has diverse
geometries. We test Hamiltonian functions of different forms and verify the
performance of our approach on two graph node embedding downstream tasks: node
classification and link prediction. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our
approach adapts better to different types of graph datasets than popular

known to show a transition from a disease-free to an endemic equilibrium as the
basic reproduction number $r_0$ is raised above threshold. It is shown that
this model maps to Hethcote's classic endemic model originally published in
1973. In this way one obtains unifying formulas for a whole class of models
showing endemic bifurcation. In particular, if the vaccination rate is smaller
than the recovery rate and $r_- < r_0 < r_+$ for certain upper and lower bounds
$r_\pm$, then trajectories spiral into the endemic equilibrium via damped
infection waves. Latest data of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant suggest that
according to this simplified model continuous vaccination programs will not be
capable to escape the oscillating endemic phase. However, in view of the strong
damping factors predicted by the model, in reality these oscillations will

the electrostatic potential in two dimensions, inside a medium with piecewise
constant conductivity, where the boundary condition is given by the complete
electrode model (CEM). The CEM is seen as the most accurate model of the
physical setting where electrodes are placed on the surface of an electrically
conductive body, and currents are injected through the electrodes and the
resulting voltages are measured again on these same electrodes. The integral
equation formulation is based on expressing the electrostatic potential as the
solution to a finite number of Laplace equations which are coupled through
boundary matching conditions. This allows us to re-express the solution in
terms of single layer potentials; the problem is thus re-cast as a system of
integral equations on a finite number of smooth curves. We discuss an adaptive
method for the solution of the resulting system of mildly singular integral
equations. This solver is both fast and accurate. We then present a numerical
inverse solver for electrical impedance tomography (EIT) which uses our forward

insights from ensembles of similar artifact shapes. We show that by considering
all the shape information in a find collection, it is possible to identify
shape patterns that would be difficult to discern by considering the artifacts
individually or by classifying shapes into predefined archaeological types and
analyzing the associated distinguishing characteristics. Recently, series of
high-resolution digital representations of artifacts have become available, and
we explore their potential on a set of 3D models of ancient Greek and Roman
sundials, with the aim of providing alternatives to the traditional
archaeological method of ``trend extraction by ordination'' (typology). In the
proposed approach, each 3D shape is represented as a point in a shape space --
a high-dimensional, curved, non-Euclidean space. By performing regression in
shape space, we find that for Roman sundials, the bend of the sundials'
shadow-receiving surface changes with the location's latitude. This suggests
that, apart from the inscribed hour lines, also a sundial's shape was adjusted
to the place of installation. As an example of more advanced inference, we use
the identified trend to infer the latitude at which a sundial, whose
installation location is unknown, was placed. We also derive a novel method for
differentiated morphological trend assertion, building upon and extending the
theory of geometric statistics and shape analysis. Specifically, we present a
regression-based method for statistical normalization of shapes that serves as
a means of disentangling parameter-dependent effects (trends) and unexplained

However, this definition was given in a partially gauge-fixed form. In this
paper we generalize the notion of double null data in a fully diffeomorphism

that no extra conditions are needed to embed the double null data in some
spacetime. The second aim of the paper is to show that the characteristic

the height of a K-semistable metrized arithmetic Fano variety X of relative

conjecture for the canonical integral model of a toric Fano variety when n less

geometry this result yields a sharp lower bound on a toric invariant introduced
by Donaldson, defined as the minimum of the toric Mabuchi functional. We
furthermore reformulate our conjecture as an optimal lower bound on Odaka's
modular height. Along the way we show how to control the height of the
canonical toric model X, with respect to the Kahler-Einstein metric, by the
algebro-geometric degree of X in any dimension n. In a sequel to this paper our

convergence of stochastic Navier-Stokes flows to the strong solution of the

scaling of $\nu^\frac{1}{2}$, before considering a new parameter which
approaches zero with viscosity but at a potentially different rate. We
determine the implications of this for our criterion and clarify a sense in
which the scaling by $\nu^\frac{1}{2}$ is optimal. To enable the analysis we
prove the existence of probabilistically weak, analytically weak solutions to a
general stochastic Navier-Stokes Equation on a bounded domain with no-slip
boundary condition in three spatial dimensions, as well as the existence and

classification tasks, they often exhibit a worrying lack of robustness towards
adversarially generated examples. Thus, considerable effort has been invested
into reformulating Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) into an adversarially
robust framework. Recently, attention has shifted towards approaches which
interpolate between the robustness offered by adversarial training and the
higher clean accuracy and faster training times of ERM. In this paper, we take
a fresh and geometric view on one such method -- Probabilistically Robust
Learning (PRL) (Robey et al., ICML, 2022). We propose a geometric framework for
understanding PRL, which allows us to identify a subtle flaw in its original
formulation and to introduce a family of probabilistic nonlocal perimeter
functionals to address this. We prove existence of solutions using novel
relaxation methods and study properties as well as local limits of the
introduced perimeters.",,,,cs.LG,"cs.LG,math.AP,math.OC,stat.ML",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18779v1,"Leon Bungert,NicolÃ¡s GarcÃ­a Trillos,Matt Jacobs,Daniel McKenzie,ÄorÄe NikoliÄ,Qingsong Wang",it begins with a boundary a geometric view on probabilistically robust learningalthough deep neural networks have achieved super human performance on many classification tasks they often exhibit a worrying lack of robustness towards adversarially generated examples thus considerable effort has been invested into reformulating empirical risk minimization erm into an adversarially robust framework recently attention has shifted towards approaches which interpolate between the robustness offered by adversarial training and the higher clean accuracy and faster training times of erm in this paper we take a fresh and geometric view on one such method probabilistically robust learning prl robey et al icml  we propose a geometric framework for understanding prl which allows us to identify a subtle flaw in its original formulation and to introduce a family of probabilistic nonlocal perimeter functionals to address this we prove existence of solutions using novel relaxation methods and study properties as well as local limits of the introduced perimeters

Schr\""odinger equation, formulated on the half-line. We consider the scenario
of associated coefficients such that only one boundary condition is required,
which is assumed to be Dirichlet type. Our functional framework centers around
fractional Sobolev spaces. We treat both high regularity and low regularity
solutions: in the former setting, the relevant nonlinearity can be handled via
the Banach algebra property; in the latter setting, however, delicate
Strichartz estimates must be established. This task is especially challenging
in the framework of nonhomogeneous initial-boundary value problems, as it
involves proving boundary-type Strichartz estimates that are not common in the
study of initial value problems.
  The linear analysis, which is the core of this work, crucially relies on a
weak solution formulation defined through the novel solution formulae obtained
via the Fokas method. In this connection, we note that the higher-order
Schr\""odinger equation comes with an increased level of difficulty due to the
presence of more than one spatial derivative. This feature manifests itself via
several complications throughout the analysis, including (i) analyticity issues
related to complex square roots, which require careful treatment of branch cuts
and deformations of integration contours; (ii) singularities that emerge upon
changes of variables in the Fourier analysis arguments; (iii) complicated
oscillatory kernels in the weak solution formula for the linear
initial-boundary value problem, which require a subtle analysis of the
dispersion in terms of the regularity of the boundary data. The present work
provides a first, complete treatment via the Fokas method of a nonhomogeneous
initial-boundary value problem for a partial differential equation associated
with a multi-term linear differential operator.","30 pages, 2 figures",,,math.AP,"math.AP,35Q55, 35Q53, 35G16, 35G31",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18202v1,"Aykut AlkÄ±n,Dionyssios Mantzavinos,TÃ¼rker ÃzsarÄ±",local well posedness of the higher order nonlinear schroedinger equation on the half line single boundary condition casewe establish local well posedness for the higher order nonlinear schrodinger equation formulated on the half line we consider the scenario of associated coefficients such that only one boundary condition is required which is assumed to be dirichlet type our functional framework centers around fractional sobolev spaces we treat both high regularity and low regularity solutions in the former setting the relevant nonlinearity can be handled via the banach algebra property in the latter setting however delicate strichartz estimates must be established this task is especially challenging in the framework of nonhomogeneous initial boundary value problems as it involves proving boundary type strichartz estimates that are not common in the study of initial value problems the linear analysis which is the core of this work crucially relies on a weak solution formulation defined through the novel solution formulae obtained via the fokas method in this connection we note that the higher order schrodinger equation comes with an increased level of difficulty due to the presence of more than one spatial derivative this feature manifests itself via several complications throughout the analysis including i analyticity issues related to complex square roots which require careful treatment of branch cuts and deformations of integration contours ii singularities that emerge upon changes of variables in the fourier analysis arguments iii complicated oscillatory kernels in the weak solution formula for the linear initial boundary value problem which require a subtle analysis of the dispersion in terms of the regularity of the boundary data the present work provides a first complete treatment via the fokas method of a nonhomogeneous initial boundary value problem for a partial differential equation associated with a multi term linear differential operator
