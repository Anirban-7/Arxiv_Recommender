    "\n",
    "1. pre-trained Word2Vec \n",
    "2. Doc2Vec with Distributed Bag of Words\n",
    "3. Doc2Vec with Dsitributed Memory.\n",

    "We implement functions that allow for the user to enter one or more articles (denoted by their arXiv ids) and request some number $n>0$ of recommendations. We will use `cosine similarity` of the word/sentence embeddings of the article abstracts as our similary measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note: In this notebook of the recommendations for multiple inputs are made in the following manner: \n",
    "#### (1) For each the abstract of each input article compute the cosine similarities with all of the elements in the dataset add them to a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (2) Sort the rows in the dataset created in part (1) from highest to lowest by cosine similarity. Remove all duplicate articles from the dataset keeping only the ones with the largest cosine similarity.  Return the first $n$ articles in the dataset."

      "   For any finite group G we define the moduli space of pointed admissible Gcovers and the concept of a Gequivariant cohomological field theory (GCohFT), which, when G is the trivial group, reduce to the moduli space of stable curves and a cohomological field theory (CohFT), respectively. We prove that by taking the \"quotient\" by G, a GCohFT reduces to a CohFT. We also prove that a GCohFT contains a GFrobenius algebra, a Gequivariant generalization of a Frobenius algebra, and that the \"quotient\" by G agrees with the obvious Frobenius algebra structure on the space of Ginvariants, after rescaling the metric.   We also introduce the moduli space of Gstable maps into a smooth, projective variety X with G action. GromovWittenlike invariants of these spaces provide the primary source of examples of GCohFTs. Finally, we explain how these constructions generalize (and unify) the ChenRuan orbifold GromovWitten invariants of the global quotient  as well as the ring H*(X,G) of Fantechi and Goettsche. \n",

      "   We quantize the massless pform field that obeys the generalized Maxwell field equations in curved spacetimes of dimension n > 1. We begin by showing that the classical Cauchy problem of the generalized Maxwell field is well posed and that the field possess the expected gauge invariance. Then the classical phase space is developed in terms of gauge equivalent classes, first in terms of the Cauchy data and then reformulated in terms of Maxwell solutions. The latter is employed to quantize the field in the framework of Dimock. Finally, the resulting algebra of observables is shown to satisfy the wave equation with the usual canonical commutation relations. \n",

      "   Designing deep neural networks is an art that often involves an expensive search over candidate architectures. To overcome this for recurrent neural nets (RNNs), we establish a connection between the hidden state dynamics in an RNN and gradient descent (GD). We then integrate momentum into this framework and propose a new family of RNNs, called {\\em MomentumRNNs}. We theoretically prove and numerically demonstrate that MomentumRNNs alleviate the vanishing gradient issue in training RNNs. We study the momentum longshort term memory (MomentumLSTM) and verify its advantages in convergence speed and accuracy over its LSTM counterpart across a variety of benchmarks. We also demonstrate that MomentumRNN is applicable to many types of recurrent cells, including those in the stateoftheart orthogonal RNNs. Finally, we show that other advanced momentumbased optimization methods, such as Adam and Nesterov accelerated gradients with a restart, can be easily incorporated into the MomentumRNN framework for designing new recurrent cells with even better performance.

To this end, we study what we denote the total cut locus, which does not appear to have been explicitly considered in the literature. To the knowledge of the author, the GC is a new invariant of a metric space. Furthermore, just like the TC, the GC has potential applications to the field of robotics. \n",

We will say that W is a Ggraded twisted algebra (not necessarily commutative, neither associative) if there exists a Ggrading W=\\bigoplus_{g \\in G}W_{g} where each summand W_{g} is a free rank one R module, and W has no monomial zero divisors (for each pair of nonzero elements w_{a},w_{b} en W_{a} and W_{b} their product is not zero, w_{a}w_{b}\\neq 0). It is also assumed that W has an identity element. In this article, methods of group cohomology are used to study the general problem of classification under graded isomorphisms. We give a full description of these algebras in the associative cases, for complex and real algebras. In the nonassociative case, an analogous result is obtained under a symmetry condition of the corresponding associative function of the algebra, and when the group providing the grading is finite cyclic. \n",

      "\n",
      "   We study the phenomenon of Hilbert space fragmentation in isolated Hamiltonian and Floquet quantum systems using the language of commutant algebras, the algebra of all operators that commute with each term of the Hamiltonian or each gate of the circuit. We provide a precise definition of Hilbert space fragmentation in this formalism as the case where the dimension of the commutant algebra grows exponentially with the system size. Fragmentation can hence be distinguished from systems with conventional symmetries such as  or , where the dimension of the commutant algebra grows polynomially with the system size. Further, the commutant algebra language also helps distinguish between \"classical\" and \"quantum\" Hilbert space fragmentation, where the former refers to fragmentation in the product state basis. We explicitly construct the commutant algebra in several systems exhibiting classical fragmentation, including the  model and the spin1 dipoleconserving model, and we illustrate the connection to previouslystudied \"Statistically Localized Integrals of Motion\" (SLIOMs). We also revisit the TemperleyLieb spin chains, including the spin1 biquadratic chain widely studied in the literature, and show that they exhibit quantum Hilbert space fragmentation. Finally, we study the contribution of the full commutant algebra to the Mazur bounds in various cases. In fragmented systems, we use expressions for the commutant to analytically obtain new or improved Mazur bounds for autocorrelation functions of local operators that agree with previous numerical results. In addition, we are able to rigorously show the localization of the onsite spin operator in the spin1 dipoleconserving model. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "   In the context of mathematical hydrodynamics, we consider the group theory structure which underlies the ABCflow introduced by Beltrami, Arnold and Childress. Beltrami equation is the eigenstate equation for the first order LaplaceBeltrami operator *d, which we solve by using harmonic analysis. Taking torus T^3 constructed as R^3/L, where L is a crystallographic lattice, we present a general algorithm to construct solutions of Beltrami equation which utilizes as main ingredient the orbits under the action of the point group P_L of threevectors in the momentum lattice L*. We introduce the new notion of a Universal Classifying Group GU_L which contains all crystallographic space groups as proper subgroups. We show that the *deigenfunctions are naturally arranged into irreducible representations of GU_L and by means of a systematic use of the branching rules with respect to various possible subgroups H of GU_L we search and find Beltrami fields with non trivial hidden symmetries. In the case of the cubic lattice the point group P_L is the proper octahedral group O_24 and the Universal Classifying Group is finite group G_1536 of order 1536 which we study in full detail deriving all of its 37 irreducible representations and the associated character table. We show that the O_24 orbits in the cubic lattice are arranged into 48 equivalence classes, the parameters of the corresponding Beltrami vector fields filling all the 37 irreducible representations of G_1536. In this way we obtain an exhaustive classification of all generalized ABCflows and of their hidden symmetries. We make several conceptual comments about the possible relation of ArnoldBeltrami flows with (supersymmetric) ChernSimons gauge theories. We also suggest linear generalizations of Beltrami equation to higher odddimensions that possibly make contact with Mtheory and the geometry of fluxcompactifications. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "   In the present paper, we associate the techniques of the LewyPinchuk reflection principle with the BehnkeSommer continuity principle. Extending a socalled reflection function to a parameterized congruence of Segre varieties, we are led to studying the envelope of holomorphy of a certain domain covered by a smooth Leviflat ``hat''. In our main theorem, we show that every C^inftysmooth CR diffeomorphism h: M to M' between two globally minimal real analytic hypersurfaces in C^n (n >1) is real analytic at every point of M if M' is holomorphically nondegenerate. More generally, we establish that the reflection function R_h' associated to such a C^inftysmooth CR diffeomorphism between two globally minimal hypersurfaces in C^n (n > 1) always extends holomorphically to a neighborhood of the graph of \\bar{h} in M\\times \\bar{M}', without any nondegeneracy condition on M'. This gives a new version of the Schwarz symmetry principle in several complex variables. Finally, as an appendix, we show that every C^inftysmooth CR mapping h: M to M' between two real analytic hypersurfaces containing no complex curves is real analytic at every point of M, without any rank condition on h. This answers a conjecture, explicitely stated for C^inftysmooth maps at p.~328 of the survey article: S.M. Baouendi, P. Ebenfelt and L.P. Rothschild, Bull. Amer. Math. Soc.

      "   In this paper we consider the onedimensional NavierStokes system for a heatconducting, compressible reacting mixture which describes the dynamic combustion of fluids of mixed kinds on unbounded domains. This model has been discussed on bounded domains by Chen (SIAM Jour. Math. Anal., 23 (1992), 609634) and ChenHoffTrivisa (Arch. Rat. Mech. Anal. 166 (2003), 321358) among others, in which the reaction rate function is a discontinuous function obeying the Arrhenius Law. We prove the global existence of weak solutions to this model on onedimensional unbounded domains with large initial data in . Moreover, the largetime behaviour of the weak solution is identified and proved. In particular, the uniformintime bounds for the temperature and specific volume have been established via energy estimates. For this purpose we utilise techniques developed by Kazhikhov and coauthors ({\\it cf.} Siber. Math. Jour. 23 (1982), 4449; Jour. Appl. Math. Mech., 41 (1977), 273282), as well as a crucial estimate in the recent work by LiLiang (Arch. Rat. Mech. Anal. 220 (2016), 11951208). Several new estimates are also established, in order to treat the unbounded domain and the reacting terms. \n",

The main notion studied is called input to output stability (IOS), and it reduces to input to state stability (ISS) when the output equals the complete state. Several variants, which formalize in different manners the transient behavior, are introduced. The main results provide a comparison among these notions. A companion paper establishes necessary and sufficient Lyapunovtheoretic characterizations. \n",

      "   We discuss the systematic expansion of the solution of the FokkerPlanck equation with the help of the eigenfunctions of the timedependent FokkerPlanck operator. The expansion parameter is the time derivative of the external parameter which controls the form of an external potential. Our expansion corresponds to the perturbative calculation of the adiabatic motion in quantum mechanics. With this method, we derive a new formula to calculate the irreversible work order by order, which is expressed as the expectation value with a pseudo density matrix. Applying this method to the case of the harmonic potential, we show that the first order term of the expansion gives the exact result. Because we do not need to solve the coupled differential equations of moments, our method simplifies the calculations of various functions such as the fluctuation of the irreversible work per unit time. We further investigate the exact optimized protocol to minimize the irreversible work by calculating its variation with respect to the control parameter itself. \n",

Application of the Schur complement method in many situations reduces the spectral problem to study of invariant sets (very often of the type of a ``strange attractor'') of a multidimensional rational transformation. A number of illustrating examples is provided.

      "   In this paper we extend the construction of special representations to convexcocompact isometry groups of CAT(1) spaces which admits complementary series. We prove that these limits of complementary series have a natural nonvanishing reduced cohomology class . As a by product we generalize Kuhn Vershik formula and characterize geometrically CAT(1) groups that admit complementary series. Investigating dynamical properties of the cohomology class  we prove an cocycle equidistribution theorem \\`a la RoblinMargulis and deduce the irreducibility of the associated affine actions. The constructions and results apply beyond the class of rank 1 linear groups where the irreducibility of the affine actions associated to the canonical class , even in the case of uniform lattices in SO(n,1), SU(n,1) or SL2(Qp) with n>1 and p prime, had not been established. \n",

      "\n",
      "   We develop the theory of maximal representations of the fundamental group of a compact connected oriented surface with boundary, into a group of Hermitian type. For any such representation we define the Toledo invariant, for which we establish properties such as uniform boundedness on the representation variety, additivity under connected sum of surfaces and congruence relations. We thus obtain geometric properties of the maximalrepresentations, that is representations whose Toledo invariant achieves the maximum value: we show that maximal representations have discrete image, are faithful and completely reducible and they always preserve a maximal tube type subdomain. This extends to the case of a general Hermitian group some of the properties of the representations in Teichmuller space, as well as results due to Goldman, Toledo, Hernandez, BradlowGarciaPradaGothen. An announcement of these results in the case of surfaces without boundary  where the role of tube type domains had already been emphasized  appeared in 2003 by the same authors.   The congruence relations for the Toledo invariant involve a rotation number function related to a continuous homogeneous quasimorphism which gives an explicit way to compute the Toledo invariant. This rotation number generalizes constructions due to Ghys, BargeGhys, and ClercKoufany.   We establish moreover properties of boundary maps associated to maximal representations which generalize naturally, for the causal structure of the Shilov boundary, monotonicity properties of quasiconjugations of the circle. This, together with the congruence relations leads to the result that the subset of maximal representations is always real semialgebraic. \n",

      "   The conformal module of conjugacy classes of braids implicitly appeared in a paper of Lin and Gorin in connection with their interest in the 13. Hilbert Problem. This invariant is the supremum of conformal modules (in the sense of Ahlfors) of certain annuli related to the conjugacy class. This note states that the conformal module is inverse proportional to a popular dynamical braid invariant, the entropy. The entropy appeared in connection with Thurston's theory of surface homeomorphisms. An application of the concept of conformal module to algebraic geometry is given. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "   We elaborate on the recent proposal that intersection numbers of certain cohomology classes on the moduli space of genuszero Riemann surfaces with punctures compute treelevel scattering amplitudes in quantum field theories. The relevant cohomology classes are twisted by representations of the fundamental group that describes how punctures braid around each other on the Riemann surface, which can be used to link it to the space of kinematic invariants. Intersection numbers of said cohomology classes, whose representatives we call twisted forms, can be shown to fully localize on the boundaries of the moduli space, which are in onetoone map with Feynman diagrams. We prove that when twisted forms are logarithmic, their intersection numbers have a simple expansion in terms of trivalent Feynman diagrams allowing only for massless propagators on the internal and external lines. For physical applications one also needs to study nonlogarithmic forms as they are responsible for propagation of massive states. We utilize the natural fibre bundle structure of the moduli space, which allows for a direct access to the boundaries, to introduce recursion relations for intersection numbers that \"integrate out\" puncturebypuncture. The resulting recursion involves only linear algebra of certain matrices describing braiding properties of the moduli space and evaluating onedimensional residues, thus paving a way for explicit analytic computations of scattering amplitudes. Together with the previous reformulation of the treelevel Smatrix of string theory in terms of twisted forms, the results of this work complete a unified geometric framework for studying scattering amplitudes from genuszero Riemann surfaces. We show that a web of dualities between different homology and cohomology groups allows for deriving a host of identities among various types of amplitudes computed from the moduli space. \n",

      "   Let  be a closed 3manifold which admits an Anosov flow. In this paper we develop a technique for constructing partially hyperbolic representatives in many mapping classes of . We apply this technique both in the setting of geodesic flows on closed hyperbolic surfaces and for Anosov flows which admit transverse tori. We emphasize the similarity of both constructions through the concept of transversality, a tool which allows us to compose different mapping classes while retaining partial hyperbolicity.   In the case of the geodesic flow of a closed hyperbolic surface  we build stably ergodic, partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms whose mapping classes form a subgroup of the mapping class group  which is isomorphic to . At the same time we show that the totality of mapping classes which can be realized by partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms does not form a subgroup of .   Finally, some of the examples on  are absolutely partially hyperbolic, stably ergodic and robustly nondynamically coherent, disproving a conjecture by F. Rodriguez Hertz, J. Rodriguez Hertz and R.

      "   We recall some properties, unfortunately not all, of the Cremona group.   We first begin by presenting a nice proof of the amalgamated product structure of the wellknown subgroup of the Cremona group made up of the polynomial automorphisms of . Then we deal with the classification of birational maps and some applications (Tits alternative, nonsimplicity...) Since any birational map can be written as a composition of quadratic birational maps up to an automorphism of the complex projective plane, we spend time on these special maps. Some questions of group theory are evoked: the classification of the finite subgroups of the Cremona group and related problems, the description of the automorphisms of the Cremona group and the representations of some lattices in the Cremona group. The description of the centralizers of discrete dynamical systems is an important problem in real and complex dynamic, we make a state of art of this problem in the Cremona group.   Let  be a compact complex surface which carries an automorphism  of positive topological entropy. Either the Kodaira dimension of  is zero and  is conjugate to an automorphism on the unique minimal model of  which is either a torus, or a K3 surface, or an Enriques surface, or  is a nonminimal rational surface and  is conjugate to a birational map of the complex projective plane.

      "\n",
      "   The aim of this work is to complete our program on the quantization of connections on arbitrary principal U(1)bundles over globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifolds. In particular, we show that one can assign via a covariant functor to any such bundle an algebra of observables which separates gauge equivalence classes of connections. The C*algebra we construct generalizes the usual CCRalgebras since, contrary to the standard fieldtheoretic models, it is based on a presymplectic Abelian group instead of a symplectic vector space. We prove a nogo theorem according to which neither this functor, nor any of its quotients, satisfies the strict axioms of general local covariance. As a byproduct, we prove that a morphism violates the locality axiom if and only if a certain induced morphism of cohomology groups is noninjective. We then show that fixing any principal U(1)bundle, there exists a suitable category of subbundles for which a quotient of our functor yields a quantum field theory in the sense of Haag and Kastler. We shall provide a physical interpretation of this feature and we obtain some new insights concerning electric charges in locally covariant quantum field theory. \n",

The proof uses sheaves of symmetric differentials associated to fractional boundary divisors on log canonical spaces, as introduced by Campana in his theory of Orbifoldes Geometriques. We discuss a weak variant of the HarderNarasimhan Filtration and prove a version of the BogomolovSommese Vanishing Theorem that take the additional fractional positivity along the boundary into account.

      "   This paper is intended to describe twistors via the paravector model of Clifford algebras and to relate such description to conformal maps in the Clifford algebra over R(4,1), besides pointing out some applications of the pure spinor formalism. We construct twistors in Minkowski spacetime as algebraic spinors associated with the DiracClifford algebra, using one lower spacetime dimension than standard Clifford algebra formulations, since for this purpose the Clifford algebra over R{4,1} is also used to describe conformal maps, instead of R{2,4}. It is possible to identify the twistor fiber in four, six and eight dimensions, respectively, with the coset spaces SO(4)/(SU(2) x U(1)/Z_2) = CP1, SO(6)/(SU(3)x U(1)/Z_2) = CP3 and SO(8)/(Spin(6)x Spin(2)/Z_2). The last homogeneous space is closely related to the SO(8) spinor decomposition reserving SO(8) symmetry in type IIB superstring theory. Indeed, aside the IIB theory, there is no SO(8) spinor decomposition preserving SO(8) symmetry and, in this case, one can introduce distinct coordinates and conjugate momenta only if the Spin(8) symmetry is broken by a Spin(6) x Spin(2) subgroup of Spin(8). Also, it is reviewed how to generalize the Penrose flagpole, constructing a flagpole that is more general than the Penrose one, which arises in a particular case (Benn & Tucker description). We investigate the wellknown relation between this flagpole and the SO(2n)/U(n) twistorial structure, which emerges when one considers the set X of all totally isotropic subspaces of C{2n}, and an isomorphism from the set of pure spinors to X. Finally we point out some relations between twistors fibrations and the classification of compact homogeneous quaternionicKahler manifolds (the socalled Wolf spaces), and exceptional Lie structures. \n",

      "\n",
      "   In the context of mathematical hydrodynamics, we consider the group theory structure which underlies the ABCflow introduced by Beltrami, Arnold and Childress. Beltrami equation is the eigenstate equation for the first order LaplaceBeltrami operator *d, which we solve by using harmonic analysis. Taking torus T^3 constructed as R^3/L, where L is a crystallographic lattice, we present a general algorithm to construct solutions of Beltrami equation which utilizes as main ingredient the orbits under the action of the point group P_L of threevectors in the momentum lattice L*. We introduce the new notion of a Universal Classifying Group GU_L which contains all crystallographic space groups as proper subgroups. We show that the *deigenfunctions are naturally arranged into irreducible representations of GU_L and by means of a systematic use of the branching rules with respect to various possible subgroups H of GU_L we search and find Beltrami fields with non trivial hidden symmetries. In the case of the cubic lattice the point group P_L is the proper octahedral group O_24 and the Universal Classifying Group is finite group G_1536 of order 1536 which we study in full detail deriving all of its 37 irreducible representations and the associated character table. We show that the O_24 orbits in the cubic lattice are arranged into 48 equivalence classes, the parameters of the corresponding Beltrami vector fields filling all the 37 irreducible representations of G_1536. In this way we obtain an exhaustive classification of all generalized ABCflows and of their hidden symmetries. We make several conceptual comments about the possible relation of ArnoldBeltrami flows with (supersymmetric) ChernSimons gauge theories. We also suggest linear generalizations of Beltrami equation to higher odddimensions that possibly make contact with Mtheory and the geometry of fluxcompactifications. \n",

      "   ChernSimons theories, which are topological quantum field theories, provide a field theoretic framework for the study of knots and links in three dimensions. These are rare examples of quantum field theories which can be exactly and explicitly solved. Expectation values of Wilson link operators yield a class of link invariants, the simplest of them is the famous Jones polynomial. Other invariants are more powerful than that of Jones. These new invariants are sensitive to the chirality of all knots at least upto ten crossing number unlike those of Jones which are blind to the chirality of some of them. However, all these invariants are still not good enough to distinguish a class of knots called mutants. These link invariants can be alternately obtained from two dimensional vertex models. The matrix of such a model in a particular limit of the spectral parameter provides a representation of the braid group. This in turn is used to construct the link invariants. Exploiting theorems of Lickorish and Wallace and also those of Kirby, Fenn and Rourke which relate threemanifolds to surgeries on framed links, these link invariants in  can also be used to construct threemanifold invariants. \n",

      " [ Cosine Similarity= 0.895 ]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "   Attached to both YangMills and General Relativity about Minkowski spacetime are distinguished gauge independent objects known as the onshell tree scattering amplitudes. We reinterpret and rigorously construct them as  minimal model brackets. This is based on formulating YM and GR as differential graded Lie algebras. Their minimal model brackets are then given by a sum of trivalent (cubic) Feynman tree graphs. The amplitudes are gauge independent when all internal lines are offshell, not merely up to  isomorphism, and we include a homological algebra proof of this fact. Using the homological perturbation lemma, we construct homotopies (propagators) that are optimal in bringing out the factorization of the residues of the amplitudes. Using a variant of Hartogs extension for singular varieties, we give a rigorous account of a recursive characterization of the amplitudes via their residues independent of their original definition in terms of Feynman graphs (this does neither involve socalled BCFW shifts nor conditions at infinity under such shifts). Roughly, the amplitude with  legs is the unique section of a sheaf on a variety of  complex momenta whose residues along a finite list of irreducible codimension one subvarieties (prime divisors) factor into amplitudes with less than  legs. The sheaf is a direct sum of rank one sheaves labeled by helicity signs. To emphasize that amplitudes are robust objects, we give a succinct list of properties that suffice for a dgLa so as to produce the YM and GR amplitudes respectively. \n",

      "\n",
      "   We construct a family of infinitedimensional positive subcoalgebras within the Grothendieck ring of Hecke algebras, when viewed as a Hopf algebra with respect to the induction and restriction functor. These subcoalgebras have as structure constants the 3point genus zero GromovWitten invariants of Grassmannians and are spanned by what we call cylindric Hecke characters, a particular set of virtual characters for whose computation we give several explicit combinatorial formulae. One of these expressions is a generalisation of Ram's formula for irreducible Hecke characters and uses cylindric broken rim hook tableaux. We show that the latter are in bijection with socalled `ice configurations' on a cylindrical square lattice, which define the asymmetric sixvertex model in statistical mechanics. A key ingredient of our construction is an extension of the bosonfermion correspondence to Hecke algebras and employing the latter we find new expressions for Jing's vertex operators of HallLittlewood functions in terms of the sixvertex transfer matrices on the infinite planar lattice. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "   We study the classical RajeevRanken model, a Hamiltonian system with three degrees of freedom describing nonlinear continuous waves in a 1+1dimensional nilpotent scalar field theory pseudodual to the SU(2) principal chiral model. While it loosely resembles the Neumann and Kirchhoff models, its equations may be viewed as the Euler equations for a centrally extended Euclidean algebra. The model has a Lax pair and rmatrix leading to four generically independent conserved quantities in involution, two of which are Casimirs. Their level sets define fourdimensional symplectic leaves on which the system is Liouville integrable. On each of these leaves, the common level sets of the remaining conserved quantities are shown, in general, to be 2tori. The nongeneric level sets can only be horn tori, circles and points. They correspond to measure zero subsets where the conserved quantities develop relations and solutions degenerate from elliptic to hyperbolic, circular or constant functions. A geometric construction allows us to realize each common level set as a bundle with base determined by the roots of a cubic polynomial. A dynamics is defined on the union of each type of level set, with the corresponding phase manifolds expressed as bundles over spaces of conserved quantities. Interestingly, topological transitions in energy hypersurfaces are found to occur at energies corresponding to horn tori, which support purely homoclinic orbits. The dynamics on each horn torus is nonHamiltonian, but expressed as a gradient flow. Finally, we discover a family of actionangle variables for the system that apply away from horn tori. \n",

      "\n",
      "   Let (M,w) be a compact symplectic manifold, and L a compact, embedded Lagrangian submanifold in M. Fukaya, Oh, Ohta and Ono construct Lagrangian Floer cohomology for such M,L, yielding groups HF^*(L,b;\\Lambda) for one Lagrangian or HF^*((L,b),(L',b');\\Lambda) for two, where b,b' are choices of bounding cochains, and exist if and only if L,L' have unobstructed Floer cohomology. These are independent of choices up to canonical isomorphism, and have important invariance properties under Hamiltonian equivalence. Floer cohomology groups are the morphism groups in the derived Fukaya category of (M,w), and so are an essential part of the Homological Mirror Symmetry Conjecture of Kontsevich.   The goal of this paper is to extend all this to immersed Lagrangians L in M with immersion i : L > M, with transverse selfintersections. In the embedded case, Floer cohomology HF^*(L,b;\\Lambda) is a modified, 'quantized' version of cohomology H^*(L;\\Lambda) over the Novikov ring \\Lambda. In our immersed case, HF^*(L,b;\\Lambda) turns out to be a quantized version of the sum of H^*(L;\\Lambda) with a \\Lambdamodule spanned by pairs (p,q) for p,q distinct points of L with i(p)=i(q) in M.   The theory becomes simpler and more powerful for graded Lagrangians in CalabiYau manifolds, when we can work over a smaller Novikov ring \\Lambda_{CY}. The proofs involve associating a gapped filtered Ainfinity algebra over \\Lambda or \\Lambda_{CY} to i : L > M, which is independent of nearly all choices up to canonical homotopy equivalence, and is built using a series of finite approximations called A_{N,0} algebras for N=0,1,2,... \n",

This gives the first proof that such a trace function converges and resolves the first case of the EtingofVarchenko conjecture.   As applications, we prove a symmetry property for traces of intertwiners and prove FelderVarchenko's conjecture that their elliptic Macdonald polynomials are related to the affine Macdonald polynomials defined as traces over irreducible integrable modules by EtingofKirillov Jr. In the trigonometric and classical limits, we recover results of EtingofKirillov Jr. and EtingofVarchenko. Our method relies on an interplay between the method of coherent states applied to the free field realization of the Wakimoto module of Matsuo, convergence properties given by the theta hypergeometric integrals of FelderVarchenko, and rationality properties originating from the representationtheoretic definition of the trace function. \n",

This generalizes the theorem of Reutenauer on the abelianization of the commutant of a free Lie algebra.   Semiabelian dgLie algebras, i.e., nonpoisitively graded dgLie algebras with brackets of any elements of strictly negative degree being 0, are Lie algebraic analogs of crossed complexes of BrownHiggins. We show that dgconnections with values in such dgLie algebras give rise to higherdimensional holonomy in the strict sense, i.e., to a system of data associating an object of a strict higher category to a geometric membrane (a class of parametrized membranes up to thin homotopy). Applied to canonical connection with coefficients in the semiabelianization of f_n, this gives a way to assiociate a powerseriestype object to a geometric membrane in R^n. \n",

There exist, in fact, two such configurations  each being tied to either of the two maximal ideals of the ring  which have the Fano plane in common and can, therefore, be viewed as twins.

      "   We construct a family of infinitedimensional positive subcoalgebras within the Grothendieck ring of Hecke algebras, when viewed as a Hopf algebra with respect to the induction and restriction functor. These subcoalgebras have as structure constants the 3point genus zero GromovWitten invariants of Grassmannians and are spanned by what we call cylindric Hecke characters, a particular set of virtual characters for whose computation we give several explicit combinatorial formulae. One of these expressions is a generalisation of Ram's formula for irreducible Hecke characters and uses cylindric broken rim hook tableaux. We show that the latter are in bijection with socalled `ice configurations' on a cylindrical square lattice, which define the asymmetric sixvertex model in statistical mechanics. A key ingredient of our construction is an extension of the bosonfermion correspondence to Hecke algebras and employing the latter we find new expressions for Jing's vertex operators of HallLittlewood functions in terms of the sixvertex transfer matrices on the infinite planar lattice. \n",

      "   Let X be a complex smooth affine irreducible curve, and let D = D(X) be the ring of global differential operators on X. In this paper, we give a geometric classification of left ideals in  and study the natural action of the Picard group of D on the space J(D) of isomorphism classes of such ideals. We recall that, up to isomorphism in the Grothendieck group K_0(D), the ideals of D are classified by the Picard group of X: there is a natural fibration \\gamma: J(D) \\to Pic(X), whose fibres are the stable isomorphism classes of ideals of D (see ). In this paper, we refine this classification by describing the fibres of \\gamma in terms of finitedimensional algebraic varieties C_n(X, I), which we call the (generalized) CalogeroMoser spaces. We define these varieties as representation varieties of deformed preprojective algebras over a certain extension of the ring of regular functions on . As in the classical case (see ), we prove that C_n(X, I) are smooth affine irreducible varieties of dimension 2n. Our results generalize the description of left ideals of the first Weyl algebra A_1(C) in ; however, our methods are quite different. \n",

This generalizes the theorem of Reutenauer on the abelianization of the commutant of a free Lie algebra.   Semiabelian dgLie algebras, i.e., nonpoisitively graded dgLie algebras with brackets of any elements of strictly negative degree being 0, are Lie algebraic analogs of crossed complexes of BrownHiggins. We show that dgconnections with values in such dgLie algebras give rise to higherdimensional holonomy in the strict sense, i.e., to a system of data associating an object of a strict higher category to a geometric membrane (a class of parametrized membranes up to thin homotopy). Applied to canonical connection with coefficients in the semiabelianization of f_n, this gives a way to assiociate a powerseriestype object to a geometric membrane in R^n. \n",

We establish a canonical isomorphism between the periodic Hopf cyclic cohomology of this extended Hopf algebra and the GelfandFuchs cohomology of the Lie algebra of formal vector fields. We then show that this isomorphism can be explicitly implemented at the cochain level, by a cochain map constructed out of a fixed torsionfree linear connection. This allows the direct treatment of the index formula for the hypoelliptic signature operator  representing the diffeomorphism invariant transverse fundamental homology class of an oriented manifold  in the general case, when this operator is constructed by means of an arbitrary coupling connection. \n",

      "   Let G be a general (not necessarily finite dimensional compact) Lie group, let g be its Lie algebra, let Cg be the cone on g in the category of differential graded Lie algebras, and consider the functor which assigns to a chain complex V the Vvalued total de Rham complex of G. We describe the Gequivariant de Rham cohomology in terms of a suitable relative differential graded Ext, defined on the appropriate category of (G,Cg)modules. The meaning of \"relative\" is made precise via the dual standard construction associated with the monad involving the aforementioned functor and the associated forgetful functor. The corresponding infinitesimal equivariant cohomology is the relative differential Ext over Cg relative to g. The functor under discussion decomposes into two functors, the functor which determines differentiable cohomology in the sense of HochschildMostow and the functor which determines the infinitesimal equivariant theory, suitably interpreted. This functor decomposition, in turn, entails an extension of a Decomposition Lemma due to Bott. Appropriate models for the differential graded Ext involving a comparison between a suitably defined simplicial Weil coalgebra and the Weil coalgebra dual to the familiar ordinary Weil algebra yield small models for equivariant de Rham cohomology including the standard Weil and Cartan models for the special case where the group G is compact and connected. Koszul duality in de Rham theory results from these considerations in a straightforward manner. \n",

They are brought simultaneously to Jordan form by the modular data coming from the full (3p1)dimensional Smatrix which includes transformations of the p1 pseudocharacters.

      "   In arXiv:1901.02990v1 the equivariant quantum differential equation () for a projective space was considered and a compatible system of difference  equations was introduced; the space of solutions to the joint system of the  and  equations was identified with the space of the equivariant theory algebra of the projective space; Stokes bases in the space of solutions were identified with exceptional bases in the equivariant theory algebra. This paper is a continuation of arXiv:1901.02990v1.   We describe the relation between solutions to the joint system of the  and  equations and the topologicalenumerative solution to the  only, defined as a generating function of equivariant descendant GromovWitten invariants. The relation is in terms of the equivariant graded Chern character on the equivariant theory algebra, the equivariant Gamma class of the projective space, and the equivariant first Chern class of the tangent bundle of the projective space.   We consider a Stokes basis, the associated exceptional basis in the equivariant theory algebra, and the associated Stokes matrix. We show that the Stokes matrix equals the Gram matrix of the equivariant GrothendieckEulerPoincar\\'{e} pairing wrt to the basis, which is the left dual to the associated exceptional basis.   We identify the Stokes bases in the space of solutions with explicit full exceptional collections in the equivariant derived category of coherent sheaves on the projective space, where the elements of those exceptional collections are just line bundles on the projective space and exterior powers of the tangent bundle of the projective space.   These statements are equivariant analogs of results of G. Cotti, B. Dubrovin, D. Guzzetti, and S. Galkin, V. Golyshev, H. Iritani. \n",

      "   We consider Gaussian random monochromatic waves  on the plane depending on a real parameter  that is directly related to the regularity of its Fourier transform. Specifically, the Fourier transform of  is , where  is the Hausdorff measure on the unit circle and the density  is a function on the circle that, roughly speaking, has exactly  derivatives in  almost surely. When , one recovers the classical setting for random waves with a translationinvariant covariancekernel. The main thrust of this paper is to explore the connection between the regularity parameter  and the asymptotic behavior of the number  of critical points that are contained in the disk of radius . More precisely, we show that the expectation  grows like the area of the disk when the regularity is low enough () and like the diameter when the regularity is high enough (), and that the corresponding exponent changes according to a linear interpolation law in the intermediate regime. The transitions occurring at the endpoint cases involve the square root of the logarithm of the radius. Interestingly, the highest asymptotic growth rate occurs only in the classical translationinvariant setting, . A key step of the proof of this result is the obtention of precise asymptotic expansions for certain Neumann series of Bessel functions. When the regularity parameter is , we show that in fact  grows like the diameter with probability 1, albeit the ratio is not a universal constant but a random variable. \n",

      "   A major open conjecture on the behavior of optimal paths in random graphs in the strong disorder regime, formulated by statistical physicists, and supported by a large amount of numerical evidence over the last decade  is as follows: for a large class of random graph models with degree exponent , the distance between two typical points on the minimal spanning tree (MST) on the giant component in the supercritical regime scales like . In this paper we give the first rigorous proof of this conjecture.   We consider a supercritical inhomogeneous random graph model with degree exponent  that is closely related to Aldous's multiplicative coalescent, and show that the MST constructed by assigning i.i.d. continuous weights to the edges in its giant component, endowed with the tree distance scaled by , converges in distribution with respect to the GromovHausdorff topology to a random compact real tree. Further, almost surely, every point in this limiting space either has degree one (leaf), or two, or infinity (hub), both the set of leaves and the set of hubs are dense in this space, and the Minkowski dimension of this space equals .   The multiplicative coalescent, in an asymptotic sense, describes the evolution of the component sizes of various nearcritical random graph processes. We expect the limiting spaces in this paper to be the candidates for the scaling limit of the MST constructed for a wide array of other heavytailed random graph models. \n",

In such cases, there is a filtration of the singular set, , where x; equivalently no tangent cone splits off a Euclidean factor  isometrically. Moreover, by , . However, little else has been understood about the structure of the singular set .   Our first result for such limit spaces  states that  is rectifiable. In fact, we will show that for a.e. , {\\it every} tangent cone  at  is symmetric i.e. that  where  might depend on the particular . We use this to show that there exists , and a rectifible set , with finite dimensional Hausdorff measure , such that  is biH\\\"older equivalent to a smooth riemannian manifold. This improves the regularity results of . Additionally, we will see that tangent cones are unique of a subset of Hausdorff  dimensional measure zero.   Our analysis is based on several new ideas, including a sharp conesplitting theorem and a geometric transformation theorem, which will allow us to control the degeneration of harmonic functions on these neck regions. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "   The spherical ensemble is a wellstudied determinantal process with a fixed number of points on the sphere. The points of this process correspond to the generalized eigenvalues of two appropriately chosen random matrices, mapped to the surface of the sphere by stereographic projection. This model can be considered as a spherical analogue for other random matrix models on the unit circle and complex plane such as the circular unitary ensemble or the Ginibre ensemble, and is one of the most natural constructions of a (statistically) rotation invariant point process with repelling property on the sphere. In this paper we study the spherical ensemble and its local repelling property by investigating the minimum spacing between the points and the area of the largest empty cap. Moreover, we consider this process as a way of distributing points uniformly on the sphere. To this aim, we study two \"metrics\" to measure the uniformity of an arrangement of points on the sphere. For each of these metrics (discrepancy and Riesz energies) we obtain some bounds and investigate the asymptotic behavior when the number of points tends to infinity. It is remarkable that though the model is random, because of the repelling property of the points, the behavior can be proved to be as good as the best known constructions (for discrepancy) or even better than the best known constructions (for Riesz energies). \n",

      "   We study the droplet that results from conditioning the subcritical FortuinKasteleyn planar random cluster model on the presence of an open circuit Gamma_0 encircling the origin and enclosing an area of at least (or exactly) n^2. We consider local deviation of the droplet boundary, measured in a radial sense by the maximum local roughness, MLR(Gamma_0), this being the maximum distance from a point in the circuit Gamma_0 to the boundary of the circuit's convex hull; and in a longitudinal sense by what we term maximum facet length, MFL(Gamma_0), namely, the length of the longest line segment of which the boundary of the convex hull is formed. We prove that that there exists a constant c > 0 such that the conditional probability that the normalised quantity n^{1/3}\\big(\\log n \\big)^{2/3} MLR(Gamma_0) exceeds c tends to 1 in the high nlimit; and that the same statement holds for n^{2/3}\\big(\\log n \\big)^{1/3} MFL(Gamma_0). To obtain these bounds, we exhibit the random cluster measure conditional on the presence of an open circuit trapping high area as the invariant measure of a Markov chain that resamples sections of the circuit boundary. We analyse the chain at equilibrium to prove the local roughness lower bounds. Alongside complementary upper bounds provided in arXiv:1001.1527, the fluctuations MLR(Gamma_0) and MFL(Gamma_0) are determined up to a constant factor. \n",

      " [ Cosine Similarity= 0.869 ]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "   In this paper, we study the direct and inverse scattering theory at fixed energy for massless charged Dirac fields evolving in the exterior region of a KerrNewmande Sitter black hole. In the first part, we establish the existence and asymptotic completeness of timedependent wave operators associated to our Dirac fields. This leads to the definition of the timedependent scattering operator that encodes the farfield behavior (with respect to a stationary observer) in the asymptotic regions of the black hole: the event and cosmological horizons. We also use the miraculous property (quoting Chandrasekhar)  that the Dirac equation can be separated into radial and angular ordinary differential equations  to make the link between the timedependent scattering operator and its stationary counterpart. This leads to a nice expression of the scattering matrix at fixed energy in terms of stationary solutions of the system of separated equations. In a second part, we use this expression of the scattering matrix to study the uniqueness property in the associated inverse scattering problem at fixed energy. Using essentially the particular form of the angular equation (that can be solved explicitely by Frobenius method) and the Complex Angular Momentum technique on the radial equation, we are finally able to determine uniquely the metric of the black hole from the knowledge of the scattering matrix at a fixed energy. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "   In nice environments, such as Lipschitz or chordarc domains, it is wellknown that the solvability of the Dirichlet problem for an elliptic operator in , for some finite , is equivalent to the fact that the associated elliptic measure belongs to the Muckenhoupt class . In turn, any of these conditions occurs if and only if the gradient of every bounded null solution satisfies a Carleson measure estimate. This has been recently extended to much rougher settings such as those of 1sided chordarc domains, that is, sets which are quantitatively open and connected with a boundary which is AhlforsDavid regular.   In this paper, we work in the same environment and consider a qualitative analog of the latter equivalence showing that one can characterize the absolute continuity of the surface measure with respect to the elliptic measure in terms of the finiteness almost everywhere of the truncated conical square function for any bounded null solution. As a consequence of our main result particularized to the Laplace operator and some previous results, we show that the boundary of the domain is rectifiable if and only if the truncated conical square function is finite almost everywhere for any bounded harmonic function. Also, we obtain that for two given elliptic operators  and , the absolute continuity of the surface measure with respect to the elliptic measure of  is equivalent to the same property for  provided the disagreement of the coefficients satisfy some quadratic estimate in truncated cones for almost everywhere vertex. Finally for the case on which  is either the transpose of  or its symmetric part we show the equivalence of the corresponding absolute continuity upon assuming that the antisymmetric part of the coefficients has some controlled oscillation in truncated cones for almost every vertex. \n",

      "   In this paper we consider a geometric variant of Hofer's symplectic energy, which was first considered by Eliashberg and Hofer in connection with their study of the extent to which the interior of a region in a symplectic manifold determines its boundary. We prove, by a simple geometric argument, that both versions of energy give rise to genuine norms on all symplectic manifolds. Roughly speaking, we show that if there were a symplectomorphism of  which had \"too little\" energy, one could embed a large ball into a thin cylinder . Thus there is a direct geometric relation between symplectic rigidity and energy.   The second half of the paper is devoted to a proof of the NonSqueezing theorem for an arbitrary manifold . We do not need to restrict to manifolds in which the theory of pseudoholomorphic curves behaves well. This is of interest since most other deep results in symplectic topology are generalised from Euclidean space to other manifolds by using this theory, and hence are still not known to be valid for arbitrary symplectic manifolds. \n",

As a byproduct we prove a generalized spherical harmonics expansion suited for Maxwell equations. In particular, our solution theory will allow us to give meaning to higher powers of a special static solution operator. Finally we show, how this weighted static solution theory can be extended to handle inhomogeneous boundary data as well. This paper is the second one in a series of three papers, which will completely reveal the low frequency behavior of solutions of the timeharmonic Maxwell equations. \n",

Xin (\\emph{Calculus of Variations and Partial Differential Equations. 2015, \\textbf{54}(2):19952016)}, which is an important extrinsic elliptic differential operator of divergence type and has profound geometric meaning. In this paper, we extend  operator to more general elliptic differential operator , and investigate the clamped plate problem of bi operator, which is denoted by , on the complete Riemannian manifolds. A general formula of eigenvalues for the  operator is established. Applying this formula, we estimate the eigenvalues with lower order on the Riemannian manifolds. As some further applications, we establish some eigenvalue inequalities for this operator on the translating solitons with respect to the mean curvature flows, submanifolds of the Euclidean spaces, unit spheres and projective spaces. In particular, for the case of translating solitons, all of the eigenvalue inequalities are universal. \n",

The surprising observation is that this operator can without much loss again be substituted by the Laplace operator, the more successful the larger the system under consideration is. This is due to a concentration of measure effect that has much to do with the random projection theorem known from probability theory. The text is in parts based on the publications  and  of the author and adapts the findings there to the needs of quantum mechanics.

The empirical measure on X of the process, describing the particle locations, converges in probability towards the pluripotential equilibrium measure, expressed in term of the MongeAmp\\`ere operator. The asymptotics of the corresponding fluctuations in the bulk are shown to be asymptotically normal and described by a Gaussian free field and applies to test functions (linear statistics) which are merely Lipschitz continuous. Moreover, a scaling limit of the correlation functions in the bulk is shown to be universal and expressed in terms of (the higher dimensional analog of) the Ginibre ensemble. This geometric setting applies in particular to normal random matrix ensembles, the two dimensional Coulomb gas, free fermions in a strong magnetic field and multivariate orthogonal polynomials. \n",

The most familiar example is the one dimensional complex classically associated with a graph, in which case the strips are simply copies of the unit interval (our setup actually allows for variable edge length). A leading key example is treebolic space, a geometric object studied in a number of recent articles, which arises as a horocyclic product of a metric tree with the hyperbolic plane. In this case, the graph is a regular tree, the strips are the closed unit interval times the real line, and each strip is equipped with the hyperbolic geometry of a specific strip in upper half plane. We consider natural families of Dirichlet forms on a general strip complex and show that the associated heat kernels and harmonic functions have very strong smoothness properties. We study questions such as essential selfadjointness of the underlying differential operator acting on a suitable space of smooth functions satisfying a Kirchoff type condition at points where the strip complex bifurcates. Compatibility with projections that arise from proper group actions is also considered. \n",

      "   We investigate here the interactions of waves governed by a Boussinesq system with a partially immersed body allowed to move freely in the vertical direction. We show that the whole system of equations can be reduced to a transmission problem for the Boussinesq equations with transmission conditions given in terms of the vertical displacement of the object and of the average horizontal discharge beneath it; these two quantities are in turn determined by two nonlinear ODEs with forcing terms coming from the exterior wavefield. Understanding the dispersive contribution to the added mass phenomenon allows us to solve these equations, and a new dispersive hidden regularity effect is used to derive uniform estimates with respect to the dispersive parameter. We then derive an abstract general Cummins equation describing the motion of the solid in the return to equilibrium problem and show that it takes an explicit simple form in two cases, namely, the nonlinear non dispersive and the linear dispersive cases; we show in particular that the decay rate towards equilibrium is much smaller in the presence of dispersion. The latter situation also involves an initial boundary value problem for a nonlocal scalar equation that has an interest of its own and for which we consequently provide a general analysis. \n",

      "\n",
      "   We consider finegrained probes of the entanglement structure of two dimensional conformal field theories deformed by the irrelevant doubletrace operator  and its closely related but nonetheless distinct singletrace counterpart. For holographic conformal field theories, these deformations can be interpreted as modifications of bulk physics in the ultraviolet region of antide Sitter space. Consequently, we can use the RyuTakayanagi formula and its generalizations to mixed state entanglement measures to test highly nontrivial consistency conditions. In general, the agreement between bulk and boundary quantities requires the equivalence of partition functions on manifolds of arbitrary genus. For the singletrace deformation, which is dual to an asymptotically linear dilaton geometry, we find that the mutual information and reflected entropy diverge for disjoint intervals when the separation distance approaches a minimum, finite value that depends solely on the deformation parameter. This implies that the mutual information fails to serve as a geometric regulator which is related to the breakdown of the split property at the inverse Hagedorn temperature. In contrast, for the doubletrace deformation, which is dual to antide Sitter space with a finite radial cutoff, we find all divergences to disappear including the standard quantum field theory ultraviolet divergence that is generically seen as disjoint intervals become adjacent. We furthermore compute reflected entropy in conformal perturbation theory. While we find formally similar behavior between bulk and boundary computations, we find quantitatively distinct results. We comment on the interpretation of these disagreements and the physics that must be altered to restore consistency. We also briefly discuss the  and  deformations. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "   Many electronic systems exhibit striking features in their dynamical response over a prominent range of experimental parameters. While there are empirical suggestions of particular increasing length scales that accompany such transitions, this identification is not universal. To better understand such behavior in quantum systems, we extend a known mapping (earlier studied in stochastic, or supersymmetric, quantum mechanics) between finite temperature classical FokkerPlanck systems and related quantum systems at zero temperature to include general nonequilibrium dynamics. Unlike Feynman mappings or stochastic quantization methods (or holographic type dualities), the classical systems that we consider and their quantum duals reside in the same number of spacetime dimensions. The upshot of our exact result is that a Wick rotation relates (i) dynamics in general finite temperature classical dissipative systems to (ii) zero temperature dynamics in the corresponding dual manybody quantum systems. Using this correspondence, we illustrate that, even in the absence of imposed disorder, many continuum quantum fluid systems (and possible lattice counterparts) may exhibit a zeropoint \"quantum dynamical heterogeneity\" wherein the dynamics, at a given instant, is spatially nonuniform. While the static length scales accompanying this phenomenon do not exhibit a clear divergence in standard correlation functions, the length scale of the dynamical heterogeneities can increase dramatically. We study \"quantum jamming\" and illustrate how a hard core bosonic system may undergo a zero temperature quantum critical metaltoinsulatortype transition with an extremely large effective dynamical exponent z>4 consistent with length scales that increase far more slowly than the relaxation time as a putative critical transition is approached. We suggest ways to analyze experimental data. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "   Coupled oscillator models where  oscillators are identical and symmetrically coupled to all others with full permutation symmetry  are found in a variety of applications. Much, but not all, work on phase descriptions of such systems consider the special case of pairwise coupling between oscillators. In this paper, we show this is restrictive  and we characterise generic multiway interactions between oscillators that are typically present, except at the very lowest order near a Hopf bifurcation where the oscillations emerge. We examine a network of identical weakly coupled dynamical systems that are close to a supercritical Hopf bifurcation by considering two parameters,  (the strength of coupling) and  (an unfolding parameter for the Hopf bifurcation). For small enough  there is an attractor that is the product of  stable limit cycles; this persists as a normally hyperbolic invariant torus for sufficiently small . Using equivariant normal form theory, we derive a generic normal form for a system of coupled phase oscillators with  symmetry. For fixed  and taking the limit , we show that the attracting dynamics of the system on the torus can be well approximated by a coupled phase oscillator system that, to lowest order, is the wellknown KuramotoSakaguchi system of coupled oscillators. The next order of approximation genericlly includes terms with up to four interacting phases, regardless of . Using a normalization that maintains nontrivial interactions in the limit , we show that the additional terms can lead to new phenomena in terms of coexistence of twocluster states with the same phase difference but different cluster size. \n",

      "\n",
      "   We provide a natural generalization of a Riemannian structure, i.e., a metric, recently introduced by Sj\\\"{o}qvist for the space of non degenerate density matrices, to the degenerate case, i.e., the case in which the eigenspaces have dimension greater than or equal to 1. We present a physical interpretation of the metric in terms of an interferometric measurement. We apply this metric, physically interpreted as an interferometric susceptibility, to the study of topological phase transitions at finite temperatures for band insulators. We compare the behaviors of this susceptibility and the one coming from the wellknown Bures metric, showing them to be dramatically different. While both infer zero temperature phase transitions, only the former predicts finite temperature phase transitions as well. The difference in behaviors can be traced back to a symmetry breaking mechanism, akin to LandauGinzburg theory, by which the Uhlmann gauge group is broken down to a subgroup determined by the type of the system's density matrix (i.e., the ranks of its spectral projectors). \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "   We consider the Laplacian associated with a general metric in the canonical conformal structure of the noncommutative two torus, and calculate a local expression for the term a_4 that appears in its corresponding smalltime heat kernel expansion. The final formula involves one variable functions and lengthy two, three and four variable functions of the modular automorphism of the state that encodes the conformal perturbation of the flat metric. We confirm the validity of the calculated expressions by showing that they satisfy a family of conceptually predicted functional relations. By studying these functional relations abstractly, we derive a partial differential system which involves a natural action of cyclic groups of order two, three and four and a flow in parameter space. We discover symmetries of the calculated expressions with respect to the action of the cyclic groups. In passing, we show that the main ingredients of our calculations, which come from a rearrangement lemma and relations between the derivatives up to order four of the conformal factor and those of its logarithm, can be derived by finite differences from the generating function of the Bernoulli numbers and its multiplicative inverse. We then shed light on the significance of exponential polynomials and their smooth fractions in understanding the general structure of the noncommutative geometric invariants appearing in the heat kernel expansion. As an application of our results we obtain the a_4 term for noncommutative four tori which split as products of two tori. These four tori are not conformally flat and the a_4 term gives a first hint of the Riemann curvature and the higher dimensional modular structure. \n",

The linearization of this flow is interpreted here as the heat flow of the LaplaceBeltrami operator of a suitable Riemannian Manifold , with a metric  which is conformal to the standard  metric. Studying the pointwise heat kernel behaviour allows to prove {suitable GagliardoNirenberg} inequalities associated to the generator.

We derive a closed form formula for the long time asymptotics of the arbitrary point correlator using the ground state eigenvalue perturbation approach proposed in . In turn, appealing to the conclusion of the Hausdorff moment problem , we discover a diffusion equation with a random drift and deterministic enhanced diffusion possessing the exact same probability distribution function at long times. Such equations enjoy many ergodic properties which immediately translate to ergodicity results for the original problem. In particular, we establish that the first two Aris moments using a single realization of the random field can be used to explicitly construct all ensemble averaged moments. Also, the first two ensemble averaged moments explicitly predict any long time centered Aris moment. Our formulae quantitatively depict the dependence of the deterministic effective diffusion on the interaction between spatial structure of flow and random temporal fluctuation. This noteably contrasts the white noise case from the OU case. Further, this approximation provides many identities regarding the stationary OU process dependent time integral. We derive explicit formulae for the decaying passive scalar's long time limiting probability distribution function (PDF) for different types of initial conditions (e.g. deterministic and random).

We examine continuoustime autonomous dynamical systems exhibiting a stable limit cycle, perturbed by additive Gaussian white noise. We derive a formal approximation for the dynamics of sample paths that stay close to the limit cycle, in terms of a phase coordinate and a deviation perpendicular to the limit cycle. To leading order in the deviation, the phase advances at the deterministic speed superimposed by a Brownianmotionlike drift. The deviation itself takes the form of an (n1)dimensional OrnsteinUhlenbeck process. We apply these results to the case of limit cycles emerging through a supercritical Hopf bifurcation, which is widespread in ecological and epidemiological models. We derive approximation formulas for the system's stationary autocovariance and power spectral density. The latter two reflect the effects of perturbations on the temporal coherence and spectral bandwidth of perturbed limit cycles. We verify our results using numerical simulations and exemplify their application to the El Ni\\~no Southern Oscillation. \n",

      "\n",
      "   In this paper we develop new techniques for revealing geometrical structures in phase space that are valid for aperiodically time dependent dynamical systems, which we refer to as Lagrangian descriptors. These quantities are based on the integration, for a finite time, along trajectories of an intrinsic bounded, positive geometrical and/or physical property of the trajectory itself. We discuss a general methodology for constructing Lagrangian descriptors, and we discuss a \"heuristic argument\" that explains why this method is successful for revealing geometrical structures in the phase space of a dynamical system. We support this argument by explicit calculations on a benchmark problem having a hyperbolic fixed point with stable and unstable manifolds that are known analytically. Several other benchmark examples are considered that allow us the assess the performance of Lagrangian descriptors in revealing invariant tori and regions of shear. Throughout the paper \"sidebyside\" comparisons of the performance of Lagrangian descriptors with both finite time Lyapunov exponents (FTLEs) and finite time averages of certain components of the vector field (\"time averages\") are carried out and discussed. In all cases Lagrangian descriptors are shown to be both more accurate and computationally efficient than these methods. We also perform computations for an explicitly three dimensional, aperiodically timedependent vector field and an aperiodically time dependent vector field defined as a data set. Comparisons with FTLEs and time averages for these examples are also carried out, with similar conclusions as for the benchmark examples. \n",

      "   Fermionic systems differ from bosonic ones in several ways, in particular that the timereversal operator  is odd, . For symmetric bosonic systems, the nosignaling principle and the quantum brachistochrone problem have been studied to some degree, both of them controversially. In this paper, we apply the basic methods proposed for bosonic systems to {\\it fermionic} two and fourdimensional symmetric Hamiltonians, and obtain several surprising results: We find  in contrast to the bosonic case  that the nosignaling principle is upheld for twodimensional fermionic Hamiltonians, however, the  symmetry is broken. In addition, we find that the time required for the evolution from a given initial state, the spinup, to a given final state, the spindown, is a constant, independent of the parameters of the Hamiltonian, under the eigenvalue constraint. That is, it cannot  as in the bosonic case  be optimized. We do, however, also find a dimensional dependence: fourdimensional symmetric fermionic Hamiltonians considered here again uphold the nosignaling principle, but it is not essential that the  symmetry be broken. The symmetry is, however, broken if the measure of entanglement is conserved. In the fourdimensional systems, the evolution time between orthogonal states is dependent on the parameters of the Hamiltonian, with the conclusion that it again can be optimized, and approach zero under certain circumstances. However, if we require the conservation of entanglement, the transformation time between these two states becomes the same constant as found in the twodimensional case, which coincides with the minimum time for such a transformation to take place in the Hermitian case. \n",

      "   Secondorder conformal quantum superintegrable systems in 2 dimensions are Laplace equations on a manifold with an added scalar potential and  independent 2nd order conformal symmetry operators. They encode all the information about 2D Helmholtz or timeindependent Schr\\\"odinger superintegrable systems in an efficient manner: Each of these systems admits a quadratic symmetry algebra (not usually a Lie algebra) and is multiseparable. We study the separation equations for the systems as a family rather than separate cases. We show that the separation equations comprise all of the various types of hypergeometric and Heun equations in full generality. In particular, they yield all of the 1D Schr\\\"odinger exactly solvable (ES) and quasiexactly solvable (QES) systems related to the Heun operator. We focus on complex constant curvature spaces and show explicitly that there are 8 pairs of Laplace separation types and these types account for all separable coordinates on the 20 flat space and 9 2sphere Helmholtz superintegrable systems, including those for the constant potential case. The different systems are related by St\\\"ackel transforms, by the symmetry algebras and by B\\\"ocher contractions of the conformal algebra so(4,C) to itself, which enables all systems to be derived from a single one: the generic potential on the complex 2sphere. This approach facilitates a unified view of special function theory, incorporating hypergeometric and Heun functions in full generality. \n",

      "   A nonHermitian operator may serve as the Hamiltonian for a unitary quantum system, if we can modify the Hilbert space of state vectors of the system so that it turns into a Hermitian operator. If this operator is timedependent, the modified Hilbert space is generally timedependent. This in turn leads to a generic conflict between the condition that the Hamiltonian is an observable of the system and that it generates a unitary timeevolution via the standard Schr\\\"odinger equation. We propose a geometric framework for addressing this problem. In particular we show that the Hamiltonian operator consists of a geometric part, which is determined by a metriccompatible connection on an underlying Hermitian vector bundle, and a nongeometric part which we identify with the energy observable. The same quantum system can be locally described using a timedependent Hamiltonian that acts in a timeindependent state space and is the sum of a geometric part and the energy operator. The full global description of the system is achieved within the framework of a moderate geometric extension of quantum mechanics where the role of the Hilbert space of state vectors is played by a Hermitian vector bundle  endowed with a metric compatible connection, and observables are given by global sections of a real vector bundle that is determined by . We examine the utility of our proposal to describe a class of twolevel systems where  is a Hermitian vector bundle over a twodimensional sphere. \n",

The key advantages of our algebraic formulation over the usual formulation of the 1/N expansion in terms of Green's functions are (i) that it is completely local so that infrared divergencies in massless theories are avoided on the algebraic level and (ii) that it admits a generalization to quantum field theories on general Lorentzian curved spacetimes. We expect that our constructions are also applicable in models possessing local gauge invariance such as YangMills theories.   The 1/N expansion of the renormalization group flow is constructed on the algebraic level via a family of *isomorphisms between the algebras of interacting field observables corresponding to different scales. We also consider parameter deformations of the interacting field algebras that arise from reducing the symmetry group of the model to a diagonal subgroup with  factors.

First, the density matrix formalism for PTsymmetric nonHermitian Hamiltonian systems is developed. It is shown that the Lindblad operators  are pseudoHermitian, namely,  with  being a linear and positivedefinite metric, and respect the PT symmetry as well. We demonstrate that the generalized density matrix , instead of the normalized density matrix , should be implemented for the calculation of the transition probabilities in accordance with the linearity requirement. Second, the density matrix formalism is used to derive the transition probabilities in general cases of PTsymmetric nonHermitian Hamiltonians.

      "   The theory of measurements continuous in time in quantum mechanics (quantum continual measurements) has been formulated by using the notions of instrument and positive operator valued measure, functional integrals, quantum stochastic differential equations and classical stochastic differential equations (SDE's). Various types of SDE's are involved, and precisely linear and non linear equations for vectors in Hilbert spaces and for traceclass operators. All such equations contain either a diffusive part, or a jump one, or both.   In this paper we introduce a class of linear SDE's for traceclass operators, relevant to the theory of continual measurements, and we recall how such SDE's are related to instruments and master equations and, so, to the general formulation of quantum mechanics. We do not present the Hilbert space formulation of such SDE's and we make some mathematical simplifications: no time dependence is introduced into the coefficients and only bounded operators on the Hilbert space of the quantum system are considered. Then we introduce the notion of a posteriori state and the non linear SDE satisfied by such states and we give conditions from which such equation is assured to preserve pure states and to send any mixed state into a pure one for large times. Finally we review the known results about the existence and uniqueness of invariant measures in the purely diffusive case and we give some concrete examples of physical systems. \n",

      "   We review recent results on quantum reactive scattering from a phase space perspective. The approach uses classical and quantum versions of normal form theory and the perspective of dynamical systems theory. Over the past ten years the classical normal form theory has provided a method for realizing the phase space structures that are responsible for determining reactions in high dimensional Hamiltonian systems. This has led to the understanding that a new (to reaction dynamics) type of phase space structure, a {\\em normally hyperbolic invariant manifold} (or, NHIM) is the \"anchor\" on which the phase space structures governing reaction dynamics are built. The quantum normal form theory provides a method for quantizing these phase space structures through the use of the Weyl quantization procedure. We show that this approach provides a solution of the timeindependent Schr\\\"odinger equation leading to a (local) Smatrix in a neighborhood of the saddle point governing the reaction. It follows easily that the quantization of the directional flux through the dividing surface with the properties noted above is a flux operator that can be expressed in a \"closed form\". Moreover, from the local Smatrix we easily obtain an expression for the cumulative reactio probability (CRP). Significantly, the expression for the CRP can be evaluated without the need to compute classical trajectories. The quantization of the NHIM is shown to lead to the activated complex, and the lifetimes of quantum states initialized on the NHIM correspond to the GamovSiegert resonances. We apply these results to the collinear nitrogen exchange reaction and a three degreeoffreedom system corresponding to an Eckart barrier coupled to two Morse oscillators. \n",

      "   In quantum theory, real degrees of freedom are usually described by operators which are selfadjoint. There are, however, exceptions to the rule. This is because, in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, an operator is not necessarily selfadjoint even if its expectation values are real. Instead, the operator may be merely symmetric. Such operators are not diagonalizable  and as a consequence they describe real degrees of freedom which display a form of \"unsharpness\" or \"fuzzyness\". For example, there are indications that this type of operators could arise with the description of spacetime at the string or at the Planck scale, where some form of unsharpness or fuzzyness has long been conjectured.   A priori, however, a potential problem with merely symmetric operators is the fact that, unlike selfadjoint operators, they do not generate unitaries  at least not straightforwardly. Here, we show for a large class of these operators that they do generate unitaries in a well defined way, and that these operators even generate the entire unitary group of the Hilbert space. This shows that merely symmetric operators, in addition to describing unsharp physical entities, may indeed also play a r{\\^o}le in the generation of symmetries, e.g. within a fundamental theory of quantum gravity. \n",

      " [ Cosine Similarity= 0.87 ]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "   A random phase property establishing a link between quasionedimensional random Schroedinger operators and full random matrix theory is advocated. Briefly summarized it states that the random transfer matrices placed into a normal system of coordinates act on the isotropic frames and lead to a Markov process with a unique invariant measure which is of geometric nature. On the elliptic part of the transfer matrices, this measure is invariant under the full hermitian symplectic group of the universality class under study. While the random phase property can up to now only be proved in special models or in a restricted sense, we provide strong numerical evidence that it holds in the Anderson model of localization. A main outcome of the random phase property is a perturbative calculation of the Lyapunov exponents which shows that the Lyapunov spectrum is equidistant and that the localization lengths for large systems in the unitary, orthogonal and symplectic ensemble differ by a factor 2 each. In an AndersonAndo model on a tubular geometry with magnetic field and spinorbit coupling, the normal system of coordinates is calculated and this is used to derive explicit energy dependent formulas for the Lyapunov spectrum. \n",
